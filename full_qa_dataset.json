With present scanner technology, the dimensions of the prob-\nlem are changed. In such a situation, sampling inspection is a logical alternative. If \ndestructive testing is required (as with firecrackers), sampling is the only alternative. \nOtherwise, the fire-cracker manufacturer will have no product to sell. Destructive \ntesting is used in a variety of applications such as for protective packaging and for \nflammability. The sampling alternative is a boon to those manufacturers.\n8.11.1 Single Sampling Plans\nA single sampling plan is defined by the following three numbers:\nN = Lot Size (shipment size). This is the total number of items received in a \nlot. n = the sample size. The items to be inspected should be a representative \nsample drawn at random from the lot size N. Inspectors know better than to \nlet suppliers choose the sample.\nc = the acceptance number which is the maximum number of defective items \nallowed in the sample. When defectives exceed c, reject the lot, which is \nshown below in the formula.\nThe sampling process consists of inspecting n items picked up randomly from \nthe lot of N items. Suppose d items are found to be defective. The criteria to \naccept/reject the lot are given below.\n \u2212 Accept the lot if d \u2264 c.\n \u2212 Reject the lot if d > c.\nEXAMPLE\nFive items (n = 5) are drawn from a lot size of 20 (N = 200). The acceptance num-\nber is set at c = 2. Then if three items are found to be defective ( d = 3), reject the \nentire lot because d > c. If two or fewer items are found to be defective, d is either \nequal to or less than c; therefore, accept the lot. It makes sense to remove the \ndefectives from the lot. This means that ( n \u2013 2) units are returned to the lot. The \ndefectives may be able to be repaired or require scrapping.\n8.11.1.1 Operating Characteristic Curves\nAs stated above, N, n, and c represent a sampling plan. A unique operating charac -\nteristic (OC) curve can be drawn for the sampling plan. The OC curve shows the \nprobability of accepting a lot as the actual percent defective in the lot (p) goes from \nzero to one. Consider the three OC curves shown in Figure 8.16. It is assumed \nthat N and n are constant for the three OC curves; however, the values of c are \n0, 1, and 2. Let us consider the OC curve for c = 1 which is the middle curve. \nThe X-axis gives the proportion of defectives ( p) in the lot. Suppose p = 0.15. It \nmeans the production process (assuming a stable process) used to produce this lot \nproduces on an average 0.15 proportion of defectives (15%); see the discussion of",

However, \nthe state of mind that encourages creative change by means of innovation is simi -\nlar across the boards. At the root of successful innovation are competence in the \nfield, confidence in management\u2019s skills, and an ability to adapt to changing con -\nditions. Adaptability is strongly related to comfort with alteration of the status \nquo. There is much relevant literature devoted to the attributes (such as flexibility) \nrequired for adaptability. McKeown\u2019s book on Adaptability (McKeown, 2012), lists \n17 rules. Rule 2 is: All failure is failure to adapt. A cause of failure to adapt (cited by \nMcKeown) is inability to recognize the need for adaptation. At this point, it should \nbe noted that adaptability and sustainability are very closely related.\n11.2.1  Innovation Is Necessary for Humanitarian \nOperations\u00a0and Crisis Management (HO&CM)\nP/OM competence in achieving desirable innovations for \u201csociety\u201d is increasingly \ncalled upon. This is clearly the case in the area of humanitarian operations & crisis \nmanagement. P/OM is the master of processes needed for acquisition, storage, and \ntransportation of critical materials and personnel\u2014from and to\u2014the disaster zone. \nP/OM alone is capable of designing, implementing, and monitoring supply chain \noperations. P/OM is solely responsible for repair and maintenance.\nThe necessities of survival (physical and mental) must be addressed when disas -\nter strikes. While each disaster is different, there are similar patterns of what occurs, \nand what must be done. P/OM has the knowledge, experience, and connections to \ninnovate appropriate solutions. Crisis managers are systems thinkers looking at the \nbig picture of what must be accomplished with the resources at hand. The generic \nmethodology (of supply and demand) has been applied by P/OM over many years, \nbut the HO&CM application is relatively new. No pat answers exist.\nMany unique situations demand new approaches to ideation (i.e., idea genera -\ntion). These include group \u201cbrain storming.\u201d It will be useful to look at the Wikipedia \nentry for Brainstorming. This term was explained and popularized by Alex Osborn \nin his 1953 book, Applied Imagination (Osborn, 1993). In HO&CM, solutions must \nbe applicable to situations with specifics that have never been encountered before\u2014\neven if the generic circumstances are entirely familiar. One flood is not the same as \nanother to the crisis managers on the ground reacting to real people in experienc -\ning tangible disaster conditions. Particularly important is the need to innovate with \nspeed while avoiding the penalties of \u201cmaking waste with haste.\u201d\nThe tradeoff between speed and accuracy requires new methods of making \nappropriate innovative decisions. Crowdsourcing (i.e., outsourcing for ideas from \nvolunteers drawn from a broad demographic of the general public) can provide com-\npetitive advantage (CIO, 2013). Other possible approaches include: Genius Bars (as \nin Apple stores), Geek Squads (as in Best Buy stores), Knowledge Management \nMethods using data mining and intelligent repositories of relevant data, may be",

This lack is also associated with zero empowerment of employees to \ndo what makes sense instead of what the bureaucratic rulebook dictates.\nSuccess leads to complacency and arrogance, even though it does not have to \ndo so. Bureaucratic organizations are very successful at inhibiting innovation and \nchange. It remains to be seen how successful organizations worldwide will be in \nlearning to counter these inhibitors.\n2.4.3 Size of Firms and Flexibility\nIt is worth noting that small- and medium-sized firms, and new businesses as well, \ntend to exhibit greater flexibility and adaptability to change than large, centralized \norganizations. That is why, under stress, AT&T, Dell, Disney, Ford, GM, IBM, \nSony, Sears, and other giant corporations used different forms of decentralization \nto improve their chances of recovering market preeminence.\nOrganizational awareness of the need for flexibility has been recognized by \nmany large organizations but solutions for big bureaucratic companies have been \nelusive. The Iacocca Institute at Lehigh University in the United States now sup -\nports its \u201cGlobal Village\u201d as well as the \u201cGlobal Village on the Move.\u201d Both focus \non leadership and have created uniquely interesting programs to develop future \nleaders for business and industry (see http://www.iacocca-lehigh.org).\nAs cited by the study, \u201cForeign-Affiliated Firms in America,\u201d conducted by \nthe Center for the Study of Operations at Columbia University, 1991, small- and \nmedium-sized firms are organizations with about 300 people. That number has \nbeen suggested by various managers, and there is also a great deal of unanimity that \nthe upper limit should be no more than 500.\nGiven the usual proportions of administrative personnel and those of other \nfunctions, this suggests that a sensible limit for the size of an efficient production \nsystem is in the neighborhood of 100\u2013200 people. By using divisional structures, it \nis reasonable to assume that a number of relatively autonomous divisions of sensible \nsize can be related within the firm.\n2.4.4 Price\u2013Demand Elasticity and Productivity\nAlmost every company in the global market competes on price. It is one of the key \ndecision factors for customers. Quality is another key factor but it is often hidden. \nWhen a company is competing on price, it means that it will lose some sales when \na competitor offers a lower price that it cannot match. Everyone in the company \nlooks to P/OM at this point. The CEO requests increased productivity to lower \ncosts. That usually translates into attaining greater output volume. It is assumed \nthat quality will remain unchanged.\nTo ask for increased productivity is a special way of asking for lower costs. \nUnions often take it to mean work faster for the same pay, which makes them \nreluctant to participate in productivity improvement.

Sometimes, purchasing requests suppliers to submit competitive bids \nfor both cost and delivery time. The main focus in most bidding cases is to satisfy a \nconstituency (such as the US Congress) that purchases made under its watch have \nbeen made at the lowest reasonable cost. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) \nin the US Department of Justice is a statutorily created independent watchdog \nwhose mission is to detect waste and fraud. The OIG is charged with correcting \npurchasing abuses.\nThat explains why companies use bids to provide the appearance of purchas -\ning decisions that are not influenced by gifts of any kind. Regarding the use of \nbids, it can be shown statistically that as the number of bidders increases, the \nexpected profit that a company can make with a winning bid is reduced. The \nimplications for purchasing (where the objective is cost control) are that costs \ncan be reduced by inviting more companies to participate in the bidding process. \nHowever, there is a cost of reviewing each company\u2019s bid which can be time-\nconsuming and expensive. Also, the credentials of bidding companies must be \nscrutinized and a basis for establishing trust needs to be forged. With trust and \ntransparency, the need for bidding (in the first place) is diminished. However, \ngovernmental projects such as those sponsored by the US Air Force legally require \nbidding procedures that follow formal specifications and standardized proce -\ndures. The same also applies to certain industries and specific organizations that \nconsider bidding a routine method for buying items that cost more than a given \n(significantly expensive) amount.\nThere are always two points of view with respect to bidding\u2014the buyer\u2019s and \nthe seller\u2019s. In a company, materials management has the buyer\u2019s point of view of \nbidding, which is to get the lowest costs, consistent quality, fastest delivery, vendor \ncontinuity and reliability, etc.\nPAs might decide to use discretionary bidding to prevent charges of favoritism. \nBidding controls expenditures when there can be significant variation in supplier \ncharges. Bid requests state specifically all of the conditions that must be met and \nask for details of what the supplier intends, including prices, delivery dates, quality \nspecifications, checks, and assurances.\nBidding can be a costly process for the materials management buyer. This is \nespecially the case when there are many criteria upon which competing suppliers \nwill be rated. For example, the credit rating of the vendor may play a major role. \nCost also rises when there are many firms that are bidders, but advantages of having \nmany participants have been described above. On the other hand, for bidding to \nwork, there must be at least two suppliers willing to bid for the job.\nOligopolies (where the market is dominated by only a few vendors) can present \nserious restrictive trade practices. Cartels exist (such as OPEC) which have formal \nagreements for collusion concerning volume of production and prices. The airline \nindustry has been coping with such supply chain problems for one of its most \nimportant input materials for many years. In 1982, AT&T was found guilty of \nbeing a monopoly leading to divestiture of the Bell System. Many fragments of that",

Some blood \ntests take little time, while others are very time-consuming. Also, we assume that \nthe number of workers remains constant for each entire month and that no defec -\ntive items are produced. Quality control is important. The consequences of incor -\nrect results can produce both physical and mental damage. To avoid such problems, \nchecking is essential. The costs for doing that are included in the time required to \nproduce a unit.\nAs before, we make an implicit assumption that actual demand is equal to the \nexpected demand. Assume that statistical records are used to forecast the number \nof blood tests required by various medical offices on a monthly basis. Discrepancies \nthat arise between the expected and actual demands can be adjusted at the time of \nthe periodic revisions of plans. The first step in developing alternative production \nplans is to establish a production level per day for each month. This production \nlevel (of completed tests) remains constant within a given month but may change \nfrom one month to the next. The calculations for the production level per day and \nthe number of workers required to meet that level are given in Inset 7.\nWe will now develop a Level plan. It is suggested in the Problem section at the \nend of this chapter that a Chase plan be developed using the same set of numbers.\n4.5.3 Production Plans\nThe aggregate production plan specifies the number of blood test units to be pro -\nduced per day. For Example 3, the number remains constant within a given month \nbut may change from one month to the next month. Table 4.13 gives the demand \nper day for each month in the planning horizon. The calculation of demand per \nday was explained in Inset 1. The demand per day fluctuates between a minimum \nof 16.67 in October to a maximum of 29.55 in August. The average demand per \nday for the 12-month period is 23.33. We now develop our Level plan based on the \nblood-testing laboratory being currently set up to produce 21 units per day.\n4.5.3.1 Level Plan\nIn the Level plan, the production per day is constant at the average demand level of \nthe 12-month period which is 23.33 units per day. Table 4.15 gives the calculations \nfor this plan. The production in any given month is calculated by multiplying the \nnumber of days in that month by the production rate per day (23.33 units). The \nproduction numbers are rounded to the nearest integer. For example, in January, \n513 test kit units could be produced (23.33 \u00d7 22 = 513.26).\nHowever, the demand in January is for only 400 units. Therefore, 113 units go \ninto idle time (513 \u2212 400). Idle technician time cannot be stored in inventory. In \nFebruary, 467 (23.33 \u00d7 20) units could be produced, whereas the expected demand \nis for 440 test kit units. Therefore, 27 units (467 \u2212 440) are added to the idle time",

There are always some errors in fore -\ncasting. A good forecasting technique tries to minimize the errors. The forecasting \nerrors are computed by comparing the actual demand for time period t with the fore-\ncast for that same period, that is, Error (t) = Demand (t) \u2212 Forecast (t). Two kinds of \nforecasting errors can occur. First, actual demand is greater than the forecast. This \nis a forecasting underestimate. By convention, when actual demand is greater than \nforecast demand, the error term is positive. Second, actual demand is less than the \nforecast. This is a forecasting overestimate and in this case the error is negative.\nTo choose a forecasting method, it is necessary to be able to compare the errors \nthat each method generates for particular circumstances. There are several different \nways of measuring errors. The choice is dependent on the situation and what kind \nof comparison is wanted. Thus, absolute measures are used to count all errors con -\nservatively. Absolute measures mean that positive and negative errors are treated the \nsame way. The reason for doing this is to prevent positive and negative errors from \ncanceling each other out.\nIn this chapter, we will study a most commonly used method that calculates \nmean absolute deviation (MAD) of the error terms. To calculate MAD, take the \nsum of the absolute measures of the errors and divide that sum by the number of \nobservations. MAD treats all errors linearly and is a more conservative measure.\nExample: Consider the data given in Table 3.12. The demand and forecast are \ngiven for 10 periods in columns 2 and 3. Column 4 gives the error for each period, \nand column 5 gives the absolute error. The sum of the absolute errors for 10 periods \nis 171. Therefore, MAD = 171/10 = 17.10.\nTo select a particular forecasting method, say ES, we will calculate the values of \nMAD by using different values of \u03b1. The value of \u03b1 that minimizes MAD will be \nselected. Similarly, applied to the MA method, we will calculate MAD for different \nvalues of n. The n that minimizes MAD will be selected. A similar procedure will \nbe used with the WMA method to find the best combination of weights.\nManagers change forecasts that are derived by numerical methods because they \nknow about other factors that are not included in the calculations. This results in \nmodifications of forecasts that can be called predictions and estimates. It is, there -\nfore, wise to maintain a history of all forecasting errors. This should be done for all \nmethods that are used and for all personnel who are making the forecasts, predic -\ntions, and estimates. Some people are good at forecasting and others are not. Also, \nsome people are good at forecasting only under certain circumstances and not good \nin all circumstances.\nHistorical records of pertinent information are essential. Companies gain major \nadvantages by finding out who can make good estimates under what circumstances. \nFurther, there are situations where people can learn to make better forecasts, pre -\ndictions, and estimates as a result of feedback about how well they have done in the \npast. When a record is not kept, all such advantage potentials are lost.",

The conversion is successful \nif customers are willing to pay more for the services than it costs to provide them, \nincluding selling expenses and other general and administrative costs. To illustrate \na service transformation, consider an information system in a bank. Depositing a \ncheck in a bank results in the electronic transfer of funds (ETF) from the paying \naccount to the paid account, which is clearly an input\u2013output transformation.\nAnother information transformation is to take raw data and turn it into averages \nand standard deviations.

For com-\nplex systems, the reliability program plan is a separate document. For simple \nsystems, it may be combined with the systems engineering management \nplan. The reliability program plan is essential for a successful reliability pro-\ngram and is developed early during system development. It specifies not \nonly what the reliability engineer does, but also the tasks performed by oth-\ners. The reliability program plan is approved by top \n \nprogram management.\nr\neliability \nr\nequirements\nFor any system, one of the first tasks of reliability engineering is to \n \nadequately specify the reliability requirements.

These can include the devel -\nopment of new products and services as well as the processes to make and deliver \nthem. Constructing a refinery, putting the space station into orbit, writing this text \nonline, and producing a paper textbook are all projects. Consultants, both internal \nand external, are usually engaged in project management. External consultants are \nemployees of a consulting firm. P/OM is an excellent background for providing \nentree for a consulting career. Internal consulting applies only to the company for \nwhich the employee works (e.g., GE, UPS, FedEx, W. L. Gore & Associates, and \nAmgen are companies that have very successful records using their own internal \nemployees as project consultants).\nDuring volatile business times, transition management is used with vari -\nous scenarios such as downsizing, turnarounds, and business process redesign. \nCompanies have created positions that indicate responsibility for some form of \ntransition in the job title. For example, a project manager of transitions is in charge \nof downsizing or rightsizing the company, turnarounds (restoring a company that \nis in trouble to good financial health), and reengineering (starting from scratch \nto redesign the firm). Various new job titles have appeared such as outsourcing \nmanager and the transformational CEO, which indicate that the management of \nchange is taking place. For a variety of good references, see Change Management \nin Wikipedia.\nSummary\nChapter 1 begins with an explanation of P/OM. It presents the role of P/OM in \nstrategic planning for the product line and subsequently for the processes that are \nrequired to make, fashion, and deliver the products. It explains why the systems \napproach is essential for successful strategic planning of the business model using \ncoordination of all functions of the business.\nNext, the systems approach is defined as systematic and constructive meth -\nodology using systems taxonomy. The implementation of the systems approach \nemployed by P/OM is detailed and explored with examples applied to manufactur-\ning of goods and to services. In this context, production management is compared \nto operations management. Chapter 1 explains how information systems play a \nvital role in both manufacturing and services. Also, the basic model of P/OM\u2014the \ninput\u2013output transformation model\u2014is developed, along with the costs and rev -\nenue that are associated with its use.

Floor models that minimize distance traveled are explained.\nAfter quantitative modeling, it is necessary to return to the qualitative factors to \nevaluate the relevance and quality of the solutions offered by the models.

The layout of a plant specifies where various machines and equip -\nment will be placed. Layout affects the productivity and costs of transportation \n(materials handling) within the plant.\nIt is hard to believe that until the 1980s, workers in American and European \nauto-assembly plants had to bend down to install the new tires on the wheels, and \nthen tighten the tire bolts. The auto-assembly conveyors ran flat out near the ground. \nThe layout made the job not much different from changing a flat tire on the road. \nVisitors to Japanese auto plants saw that the conveyor lifted the car up at the point \nof tire attachment. This carried the car above the worker and allowed putting the tire \non at shoulder level. Workers could stand tall and attach the tires to the wheels with-\nout bending. Thereafter, conveyors that lifted the car were installed in world-class \nauto-assembly plants. This simple anecdote illustrates how good layout interacts",

This includes the business of making profit, as well as not-\nfor-profit applications. Yes, P/OM applies directly to helping people who are under \nstress (as in humanitarian operations) as well as for everyone striving to have a bet -\nter life. Since P/OM capabilities deal equally with goods and services, the fields of \nhospitality, travel, healthcare, education, entertainment, and agriculture are as vital \na part of its purview as manufacturing.\nThis list of applications should be kept in mind when reading the section \u201cTo \nwhom is this text directed?\u201d Managers in all of the fields listed above will benefit \nfrom learning more about P/OM. We hope the reader will supply categories of per-\nsonal interest that we skipped over such as sports and astronautics.\nSince the beginning of mankind on earth, if the \u201cbusyness\u201d process was suc -\ncessful, then some form of profit sustained it. There is nothing ugly about mak -\ning money. Profitability is a requisite sign of smart management and productivity \nachievement. Return on investment is the essence of sustainability. Studies show \nthat environmental concern enhances long-term profitability and generally is bene-\nficial to short-term profits as well. P/OM (more than other functional areas of busi-\nness, government, and not-for-profit organizations) impinges on the environment. \nWe used \u201cbusyness\u201d to reflect both personal task performance and work-related job \nperformance. P/OM applies to both sides of the street. A disciplined manager is \nunlikely to be bogged down by inefficient processes at home.\nP/OM\u2019s use of energy, water, and even air to make goods and provide services is \nfunctionally unique. The way that P/OM blends the talents of people with the power \nof technology resides in a special domain that no one else occupies. Cooperation \nwith allies (e.g., specialists in energy, graphic arts, information systems, market \nresearch, and managers of other technologies) is increasingly essential.\nThe special phrases of P/OM lingo (special language) reveal the extent to which \nP/OM goals focus on critically important and totally unique endeavors.

This major undertaking dwarfed all operational control \nsystems employed by OM at prior Olympics.\nIn 2013, Lenovo became the \u201cbiggest PC supplier in the world.\u201d This is accord-\ning to IDC and Gartner who track PC sales. In the second quarter of 2013, \nLenovo had 16.7%, HP had 16.3%, and Dell was third with 11.89%. This is \nan interesting business case in which Lenovo exhibits the excellent characteris -\ntics of a Stage IV company (see Section 1.15).

The business model combines marketing forces (including \ncompetition), financial investments, and operating costs. This business model had \nto be thought out in detail during strategic planning.\nA product that cannot be made or delivered on time, with quality, and at an \nacceptable cost must be referred back to marketing and general management. If \nfinancial support is insufficient to develop a satisfactory process, that fact must be \nreferred back to finance and marketing. If employee resources are inadequate to \noperate the processes, that fact must be referred back to HRM, marketing, finance, \nand general management. These and other issues place P/OM at the hub (core and \ncenter) of the business model.\nThe planning details (of the model), once accepted, have to be adhered to by all \nof the business functions. When results do not jibe with plans, it is essential that \nall parties reexamine original assumptions and make adjustments as soon as prac -\nticable. As will be recognized from the following discussion, the functional field \napproach cannot be accepted. Although this is true in general, it is particularly so \nin a global business environment. The systems approach is essential.\n1.11 Transformation Process\nAll operations management and production systems involve transformation. The \ngoal of the production/operations department is to transform the inputs (using labor, \nmachines, and materials) into desired qualities of goods and services at the mini -\nmum cost. Alteration of materials and components adds value and changes them \ninto goods and services that customers want to own. The raw materials and compo-\nnents before transformation could not be used\u2014and therefore had no utility\u2014for \nthe customer. Service conversions have customer utility even if no transfer of goods \ntakes place. The conversion may be a change of location or related to the customer\u2019s \nstate of well-being (e.g., visiting the doctor, the repairperson fixes the air conditioner \non a hot summer day, or a rescue from a disaster area during a hurricane).",

The fourth is to select furniture, lighting, decorative features, \nand equipment for doing the job. In fact, these four components interact, and none \nof them can be considered exclusive of the others. A great amount of expertise \nand management ability is required for facilities planning. A better job is done by \nbroad-based visionaries and generalists who know how to work together as a team. \nThe systems point of view has never been shown to be a weakness.\nFor facilities planning regarding location and layout, strategic thinking is \nessential to avoid suboptimization. The easiest way to define suboptimization is \nthat it is less good than optimization. Suboptimization is often the result of opti -\nmizing a subsystem instead of the whole system. It is a result, or series of results, \nthat strays from achieving the objectives that drive strategies. For example, say \nthat a theme park assigns the manager of each of its attractions the goal of mini -\nmizing waiting time of customers. That objective for each ride will produce dif -\nferent effects than a single strategic objective to minimize the total waiting time \nof customers over the course of many rides and an entire day of being in the park. \nThe sum of suboptimization results will not add up to an optimal solution. The \nsequence of rides taken, the timing of starts and completions, the encouragement \nof choosing certain intervals to eat and using the restrooms reflect the larger stra -\ntegic framework.\nWhen the real problem is too big to grasp because there are many options, \nthe systems approach is indicated. Dividing the (facilities) problem into regional \nsub-problems to make it workable can jeopardize the quality of the solution. It is \nlikely to yield a suboptimal (less than best) solution. Location, site, and building \ndecisions are major components of the larger facilities planning problem. Strategies \nthat yield suboptimal results can damage competitive capabilities. Thus, layout and \njob design are partners in the achievement of a good flow shop. They need to be \nconsidered together. In the job shop, production scheduling, shop-floor layout, and \njob design are interdependent and best approached as a system. The same kind of \nreasoning applies to the optimal facility design for a project. In all such situations, \nfacilities planning is a multidimensional systems problem. The appropriate strategy \nmust encompass all relevant elements of the minimum coherent system. To sum \nup: Suboptimization of the entire system is often more desirable than optimization \nof a large number of subsystems.\nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to:\n \u25fe Explain the four distinct parts of facilities planning.\n \u25fe Discuss who is responsible for doing facilities planning.\n \u25fe Describe the nature of facilities planning models.\n \u25fe Explain why planning for the design of facilities requires \nthe systems approach.",

The changes or \ntransitions between stages require the knowledge of knowing how to adjust the \nproduction system\u2019s capabilities.\n3.9.1  Introduction and Growth of the New Product \n(Goods\u00a0and Services)\nThere are two new product early phases of life-cycle stages. These are initial intro -\nduction and sales growth of the product. The \u201cidea\u201d for the product and its devel -\nopment precedes the introduction. The entire team works on ascertaining the \nmarketing feasibility of the idea, as well as the feasibility of making it and deliver -\ning it. Research and Development (R&D) may have made sample product so that \nmarket research can test its customer acceptability. When it is approved, P/OM and \nengineering swing into action to create the production system that can make and/\nor assemble it. During this process of bringing the idea to reality, there are many \n\u201cmake or buy\u201d analyses.\nNone of this is easy. It takes a lot of effort and attention to detail. There is much \ntime and talent needed to conceptualize the product, design its specifics, organize \nthe process for making it, cost it out, pilot test it, and so forth. When the product \nis accepted, it is released for production and marketing. All of these take place in \nthe introductory stage.\n3.9.2  Maturation and Decline of the New Product \n(Goods\u00a0and Services)\nWhen the new product or service stops growing, it is considered mature. This \nmeans that its volume is stabilized at the saturation level for that brand. The com -\npetitors have divided the market, and only extraordinary events, such as a strike at \na competitor\u2019s plant, are able to shift shares and volumes.\nDuring the introductory phase, P/OM had to deal with producing larger and \nlarger quantities of product. Now the marketing\u2013production relationship reaches \nequilibrium. Marketing takes specific actions during this phase to maintain the \nproduct\u2019s share of the market. Prices often are lowered. Coordination between \nP/OM and sales is essential to meet delivery schedules on time. Finally, the product \nbegins to lose share, volume drops, and, depending on the strategy, the product is \neither restaged or terminated.\nIt is expected that a new product will have been introduced previously that has \ngrown to a reasonable extent. It is the replacement for the other product and has \nbeen assigned the capacity of the product that has been replaced. The cycle of the \nnew product is similar to that of the one that is replaced in that it goes through",

Because there may be many varieties such as sizes and \nflavors, it is usual P/OM practice to aggregate the output into some common unit, \nsuch as standard units of toothpaste produced. Both forms of information would \nreflect the variability of demand, but the aggregate measure much less so than the \ndetailed product reports. Depending on the demand levels, the marketing depart -\nment could stimulate sales by dropping prices or raising prices to slow demand that \nis exceeding supply capabilities.\nIf lower prices are effective in generating new business, then the demand is \nsaid to be elastic to price. When there is price elasticity, operations must keep \ncosts down so that the advantage of low prices can be obtained. Marketing ulti -\nmately controls the volume of business that production must process. Financial \nplanning has determined the operating capacity for peak demand. This, in turn, \ntranslates back to the dollar amount of inputs that need to be purchased to meet \ndemand.\nThe systems perspective is required to make sure that all participants are con -\nnected directly to the revenue-generating capacity of the I/O system. The informa -\ntion system helps to foster the process of keeping connected. Many kinds of data are \nregularly transmitted between participants. For example, information about what \nis selling\u2014and what is in stock\u2014leads to production scheduling decisions. It also \nleads to initiatives by the sales department. The levels of inventory are perpetually \nexamined to make sure that no stock outages occur, and care is taken to keep track \nof what is in the finished goods inventory.\n1.13 P/OM Input\u2013Output Profit Model\nThe purpose of this section is to link the equation for profit\u2014which is critical \nfor people in business\u2014to the input\u2013output transformation model. The I/O profit \nmodel is derived from the costs and revenues shown in Figure 1.7.

Even when everything is running \u201cas planned\u201d, \nthe value of U is often less than 100%. If the system is operating even faster, the \nvalue of U can exceed 100%. There are pros and cons related to running opera -\ntional systems above the maximum rated capacity. How long maximum capacity is \nexceeded also counts.\nU is a measure to be wary of when it becomes an objective of management \nto keep U as close to 100% as possible. There are sound economic reasons not to \noperate a production department above capacity. For example, it is economically \nsensible to stop production when the planned output quota has been met and \nsafety stock is sufficient. Shutting down the production system for 2 h of an 8-h \nday means that the U measure goes to 75%. Actual measured operational capac -\nity is going to be reduced by a fourth. For various reasons, that may be a good \nthing.\nManagement must establish the fact that supply chains are composed of com -\nplex sub-systems some of which cannot function above capacity for very long. The \ncosts of unsold throughput must be analyzed. How long will stored output remain \nas inventory? Are there fluctuations in demand that they will buffer or is the buffer \nin place already? The costs of arbitrary utilization of supply chain capacity to elimi-\nnate less than 100% utilization should be recognized for what it is\u2014waste of time \nand money due to fear of seeming to waste (unutilized) capacity. An appropriate \ndecision model can be constructed to set proper supply chain throughput based on \nmaximizing the whole systems performance.\nAs an example, assume that U is 0.963. This is likely to be viewed as a more rea-\nsonable utilization factor than 0.750. P/OM, in general, will not tolerate a perma -\nnent situation where utilization factors are below 0.900. Still, the target numbers \nwill be dependent on the situation. For example, in service organizations, a high \nvalue of U might be required to keep queues short. Cyclical supply chain demand \nsystems can be expected to cycle between utilization factors in the 70% range and \nthen up to more than 100% capacity. Cyclical industry companies prefer having \nexcess capacity in reserve and expect to operate effectively below the misleading \nideal of 100% utilization.\nUsing data in Table 4.1, the value of 130 actual standard hours of throughput \non Monday might have been obtained as follows:\n C = T \u00d7 E \u00d7 U = 150 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 0.963 = 130 actual standard hours.\nThe ratio of actual standard hours to maximum standard hours is equal to \n130/150 = 0.87 or 87%.\nSuppose in a bank, there are six tellers\u2019 windows. If the bank is open for \n8 hours (h) per day, the maximum designed capacity is 48 h. This is a long-term \ndecision because the number of windows cannot be changed every day.

For each activity, the \nproject manager or the project team makes three time estimates that are intended \nto capture: optimistic time ( o), most likely time (m), and pessimistic time ( p). The \nactivity will generally be completed in the most likely time. However, if circum -\nstances are very favorable, the activity can be completed in less time. This is called \nthe optimistic time. If things go wrong with an activity than the activity may be \ndelayed, pessimistic time is an estimate of the activity time in such a situation.

This is due to their simplicity of specification. An LTI \nsystem is completely specified by its transfer function (which is a rational \nfunction for digital and lumped analog LTI systems). Alternatively, we can \nthink of an LTI system as being completely specified by its frequency response. \nA third way to specify an LTI system is by its characteristic linear differential \nequation (for analog systems) or linear difference equation (for digital sys-\ntems). Which description is most useful depends on the application.\nThe distinction between lumped and distributed LTI systems is impor -\ntant.

One example is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, \nwhich requires quality auditing to be performed as part of its Quality \nSystem Regulation (QSR) for medical devices (Title 21 of the U.S. Code of \nFederal Regulations, part 820).\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

This means that failure is regarded as \na random phenomenon: it is a recurring event, and we do not express \nany information on individual failures, the causes of failures, or \n \nrelationships between failures, except that the likelihood for failures \nto occur varies over time according to the given probability function. \nReliability engineering is concerned with meeting the specified \n \nprobability of success, at a specified statistical confidence level.\nSecond, reliability is predicated on \u201cintended function\u201d: generally, this \nis taken to mean operation without failure. However, even if no \n \nindividual part of the system fails, but the system as a whole does \nnot do what was intended, then the failure is still charged against \nthe \n \nsystem \n \nreliability. The system requirements specification is the \ncriterion against which reliability is measured.\nThird, reliability applies to a specified period of time.

The project completion time is 40 \nweeks because the length of the critical path is 40 weeks (see Figure 7.2). Suppose \nwe want to reduce the project duration, say, to 39 weeks. The length of the critical \npath must be reduced to 39 weeks. This requires that we reduce the time of one \nof the critical path activities by 1 week. For simplicity, we assume that the time \ncan be reduced by the whole integer and not reduced in fractions such as reduce \none activty by 1/2 and another activity by 1/2.

The length of the critical path will \nbecome 39 weeks, whereas the lengths of other paths remain the same. The project \nduration will be 39 weeks. See the results in Figure 7.3.\nSuppose we now want to further shorten the project duration to 38 weeks. \nAgain, we must reduce the time of one of the activities on the critical path. \nActivity A whose time is now 8 weeks may be picked again (if it is still alter -\nable with additional resources or by redesigning what must be done or one of the \nother activities can be selected for crashing). In the project-management literature, \nreducing the time of an activity is known as crashing the activity. Suppose we \nchoose activity J (with activity time of 10 weeks) for crashing. The activity of time \nJ becomes 9 weeks by calling upon additional resources. The length of the criti -\ncal path becomes 38 weeks. The lengths of all other paths also shorten by 1 week \nbecause activity J belongs to all paths. The lengths of all paths after crashing J are \nshown in Figure 7.4.\nHow do we decide which activity (activities) should be crashed?

Projects are ongoing. Teams \nare seldom halted and disbanded\u2014but they may well be redirected. Project groups \nare committed to creating streams of innovation and change. Specifically, it is nec -\nessary to be able to design a succession of upgraded configurations of the original \ninvention. This is described as creating NGPs by Laurie, Doz and Sheer (Laurie, \n2006).\nThe timing between successive launches of new members of the family will \ndepend on a variety of factors related to evolution of demand in the marketplace. \nIn particular, when a competitor directly attacks a recent innovation with improve-\nments that disrupt the growth pattern of the original product, a counter-move is \nrequired. The success of the counter-attack will depend on the existence of a strong \n\u201cplatform.\u201d Lacking a good platform, the original innovator may be obsoleted \nby competitors. The product of the original innovator will become outmoded in \ndesign, style, and/or construction within a very short time frame. The platform \nprovides conceptual and physical resources for continuity. Though continuity is \nfast becoming a standard for success, it is hardly a new discovery.\n11.6.1 Innovative W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc.\nW. L. Gore & Associates has been using continuous project systems with NGPs for \nmany years without using that specific terminology. This company was founded in \n1958 by Wilbert L. (Bill) Gore (who had been a research chemist with DuPont) and \nhis wife Genevieve (Vieve) Gore. The company sees itself as \u201cA uniquely inventive, \ntechnology-driven enterprise focused on discovery and product innovation.\u201d Gore\u2019s \nvision is clearly stated: \u201ca commitment to innovation shapes everything we do.\u201d The \ncompany remains privately held and is very successful with annual sales of $3.2 \nbillion derived from a constant stream of product innovations. Perhaps best known \nfor Gore-Tex\u00ae brand fabrics, the company continuously invents electronic, medical, \nand industrial products. Gore has been granted more than 2000 patents worldwide. \nIt is regularly listed in the top 25% of \u201cThe 100 Best Companies to Work For.\u201d \nEveryone participates in the innovation process which is conceptually equivalent to \nthe product platform planning (PPP) process we describe in the next section.",

The French Ministry of Health certified that the spring which was \nthe source of this chic bottled mineral water was not contaminated.\nWhere did the benzene come from? Eventually, Perrier found that the problem \nwas caused by charcoal filters used in the bottling process. This situation reflects \na serious P/OM failure in its responsibility for control of quality. It is not believed \nthat the charcoal filters were intended as an innovation. They were defective. The \nprocess had been changed inadvertently. Perrier had to follow a recovery plan, and \nit took a great amount of time for them to succeed. P/OM has the greatest respon -\nsibility to maintain process consistency. Every maintenance operation could be the \nsource of possible deviations from process specifications. Aircraft accidents have \nbeen traced to incorrect maintenance procedures (e.g., neglecting to put O-rings \ninto jet engines). While we advocate learning from mistakes, in aircraft mainte -\nnance, the consequences of errors can be dire.\nWe have given a number of examples of changes to products and processes \nthat failed for different reasons with serious repercussions. New product percep -\ntions among customers must be carefully scrutinized using the best available market \nresearch capabilities. New Coke would not have survived such tests. Similarly, pro-\ncesses must not be allowed to change without in-depth analysis of the results. Proper \ntests of its charcoal filters would have saved the Perrier Company from huge penal-\nties. Proper P/OM would have so advised general management that testing for pro-\ncess consistency costs very little in comparison to the costs of process inconsistencies.\n11.4.3  Unintended Consequences of Product and \nProcess\u00a0Changes\nGood innovations in production methods can provide beneficial (albeit hidden) \nrewards. For example, better cell-phone connections from towers and satellites, \nhealthier foods with sanitary harvesting, cleaner manufacturing, and fewer auto \nrecalls (caused by product design innovations interacting with vendor problems \nand process glitches). Although consumers generally do not get to see the pro -\nducer\u2019s facility, and they may not be able to discern the product changes, eventually \nthey experience both problems and advantages linked to changes. The unintended \nconsequences of defective charcoal filters for Perrier provide an excellent example. \nEventually, intangibles can have a major effect on customer loyalty. The effect of \ntangible (directly visible) innovations may be more immediate and dramatic, but \nnot necessarily as long-term and powerful.\nIt is clear that product and process innovations can introduce changes that may \nbe beneficial or harmful. What is not so evident is that they can be both. Good \nchange is evident when enough customers want to buy the new product(s) at a price \nthat ensures financial success.

Shewhart developed the theory of SQC that \nenabled manufacturing to design and control processes that could achieve these \nobjectives. SQC is discussed in detail in Chapter 8. SQC was focused on the pro -\nducer\u2019s ability to control the variability of the process that was making the parts \nthat had to fit within the specified tolerance limits. For the first time, the output \nof the transformation process could be stabilized and controlled. This was a major \ncontribution to production theory.\nWalter Shewhart\u2019s major work, which was published in 1930, described his con-\ncepts about why SQC works and how to apply it (see Shewhart 1939; Juran and \nGryna 1980; Deming 1986) also participated in the development of SQC theory \nand later on played a crucial role in its implementation and dissemination.\nThe United States was the first country that consistently used SQC, which it did \nthrough the 1940\u2019s and the early 1950\u2019s, but by 1960 the majority of SQC users were \nin Japan. US organizations reported that they had dropped SQC to make cost reduc-\ntions. Quality was considered good enough to replace costly staff departments with \ninspectors at the end of the production line. By the 1980\u2019s, however, under great com-\npetitive pressure from quality-driven Japanese organizations, many US companies \nrestored SQC and enhanced it with broader concepts into TQM activities.\nOrganizations like Motorola, Toyota, and GE are considered to be pioneers \nleading the development of TQM and Six Sigma within the framework of the \nsystems approach. The TQM approach applied to the production transformation \nsystem integrates the goals of productivity and quality. It represents a major step \nforward in the theory of production and an organizational feat to have gained broad \nacceptance at all levels. Six-SigmaSM, a registered service mark of Motorola\u2014which \ndeveloped it\u2014is a culmination of TQM.

This strategic issue must be understood \nby the functional area managers and addressed in a coordinated fashion . The stage \nreflects the degree to which a company\u2019s activities have been coordinated and car -\nried out. Thus, stage determines company effectiveness (ability to do the right \nthing) and efficiency (ability to do the thing right). As a company improves its \nstage of operations, it is expected that its profitability will increase. However, it is \nnecessary to relate the company\u2019s stage of development to that of its competitors.\nEach company\u2019s input\u2013output profit model indirectly and directly reflects the \nimpact of the competitors\u2019 input\u2013output models. The cost structures, prices, vol -\numes, and profit margins reflect the influence and extent of the competition. If the \ncompetitors all are at the same stage and one of them starts to move to a higher \nstage, the expected result is that the advancing company will gain market share, \nwhile the remaining companies experience a decrease in share and volume. This then \ngets translated into higher variable costs and lower profit margins. P/OMs must be \ninvolved in competitive analysis, which means that the company\u2019s planning partici-\npants fully understand the stages of development of all competing companies.\nHow a company manages its profit model provides insights into the role that \nP/OM can play in a company. Decisions concerning capacity and the resulting \neconomies of scale capture only a portion of the story; the extent to which new \ntechnology is utilized to offset high variable labor costs also plays a part. The \ndevelopment stage relates as well to the management of the throughput rate, qual -\nity attainment, and variety achievement.\nStage I companies operate on the premise that there is no competitive advantage \nto be gained by changing the production process. Therefore, the process usually is \nrelatively unrefined and often rudimentary and out-of-date. Management, seeing \nno leverage in processes, pays minimal attention to production and operations. \nStage I firms squeak by on quality. Because the competitors are not much bet -\nter, everyone appears indifferent. In such firms, management and its resources are \ninsufficient to do more than keep up with demand. Survival occurs only when and \nif the competition is in the same boat. The indifference to quality also happens \nwhen the company believes that repeat business is not going to occur no matter \nhow good the product they deliver.

Effective leaders overcome functional \ndifferentiation; they cut across boundaries and follow non-linear paths (Jassawalla \nand Sashittal, 2000).\nNarrow definitions of NPD project teams can be avoided by recognizing the \nbreadth of viewpoints and knowhow that will facilitate breakthrough innovations. \nFor example, suppliers of components and vendors of materials may have ideas \nthat accelerate innovation beyond traditional boundaries. Therefore, good suppliers \nmust be on the team (Handfield, 1999).\nTeams will work quickly to uncover latent problems and to gain the advantages \nof everyone (from all disciplines) knowing about the total system as early as possible. \nCosts of discovery about product and project weaknesses are relatively low at the \nstarting point of projects. They become increasingly greater after project directions \nhave been set. That is because the costs of reversals are quite high in both time and \nmoney. Figure 11.2 illustrates the typical advantage of innovations that facilitate \nearly-resource utilization in P/OM projects. Examples of benefits of understanding \nrequirements for coordination of the total system that provide faster completions \nand lower costs include: new product development (NPD) , design of processes for \nmanufacture (DFM), design for assembly (DFA), and design for rapid project com-\npletion (DFRPC).\nFor example, it would have been relatively inexpensive and far less traumatic \nto fix the Tacoma Narrows Bridge which spanned Puget Sound in the state of \nWashington, USA, instead of having to replace it.

Most hardware unreliability \nis the result of a component or material failure that results in the sys -\ntem not performing its intended function. Repairing or replacing the \nhardware component restores the system to its original unfailed state. \nHowever, software does not fail in the same sense that hardware fails. \nInstead, software unreliability is the result of unanticipated results of \nsoftware operations. Even relatively small software programs can have \nastronomically large combinations of inputs and states that are infea -\nsible to exhaustively test. Restoring software to its original state only \nworks until the same combination of inputs and states results in the \nsame unintended result. Software reliability engineering must take this \ninto account.\nDespite this difference in the source of failure between software and \nhardware\u2014software doesn\u2019t wear out\u2014some in the software reliability\u2013en-\ngineering community believe statistical models used in hardware reliability \nare nevertheless useful as a measure of software reliability, describing what \nwe experience with software: the longer you run software, the higher the \nprobability you\u2019ll eventually use it in an untested manner and find a latent \ndefect that results in a failure (Shooman 1987; Musa 2005; Denney 2005).\nAs with hardware, software reliability depends on good requirements, \ndesign, and implementation. Software reliability engineering relies heav -\nily on a disciplined software-engineering process to anticipate and design \nagainst unintended consequences. There is more overlap between software \nquality engineering and software reliability engineering than between \nhardware quality and reliability. A good software development plan is a \nkey aspect of the software reliability program. The software development \nplan describes the design and coding standards, peer reviews, unit tests, \nconfiguration management, software metrics, and software models to be \nused during software development.\nA common reliability metric is the number of software faults, usu -\nally expressed as faults per thousand lines of code. This metric, along \nwith software execution time, is key to most software reliability models \nand estimates. The theory is that the software reliability increases as the \nnumber of faults (or fault density) goes down.

However, it takes smart planning, care, and cooperation \nbetween business functions to consolidate that advantage. If advertisements fail to \nalert customers about the new product\u2019s availability, the \u201cfirst to finish\u201d advantage \nmay not occur. Retailers who are not convinced that this new product has signifi -\ncant sales potential will not stock and display these new items. One should bear in \nmind, with retail there will always be a shelf space problem; it takes a lot of experi -\nence to know how to pressure retailers into allocating space to a new product. To \navoid this problem, Apple created Apple stores as part of its total new product line \ninnovation. Apple management understood that they could never get necessary \nproduct exposure using traditional retail avenues.\nAmazon\u2019s Internet system does not face similar floor-space constraints. That is \nwhy Amazon stock is so highly valued. However, all mail-order companies recog -\nnize \u201cspace-as-a-resource\u201d limitations in a mail-order catalog. The same applies to \nradio, TV, and pop-up ads used on the Internet. Whatever method is employed to \neducate potential consumers about new product attributes, it must reach and con -\nvince a broad enough market to provide first entry advantages.\nOn-time delivery is critical. When production output falters and does not feed \nthe pipeline with new products as demanded by paying customers, it is difficult to \nrepair sales lost by insufficient stock. In the same way, consistent quality is essential. \nPrice eventually plays a major role in the determination of demand levels. At first, the \nmarket for high quality may seem indifferent to price, but once the wealthy market \nsegments are saturated, price begins to count. In other words, P/OM should always \nbe prepared to deal with problems related to price elasticity. The sales of many new \nproducts (especially of high quality) seem unaffected by elasticity constraints. P/OM \nis not under pressure to reduce process costs. Later on, when competition grows with \nlower price and equal and better quality, all operating costs begin to matter.\n11.9.1  Lean Production Methods Are a Form of \nProcess\u00a0Innovation\nIt is wasteful to incur costs which do not add value to the product for the customer. \nYet, many organizations have numerous costs that produce no tangible benefit. \nPrograms to cut such waste are called \u201clean.\u201d They were developed by the Japanese \nmanufacturers and especially Toyota. Elimination of waste (time and material) and \nsmoothing work flows (balancing process rates) is at the core of lean. The Japanese \ngoal of removing waste (mura) and unevenness (muda) has been highly successful \nin both manufacturing and service industries (such as healthcare). When operating \ncosts begin to matter, lean is often brought into the system. It should always have \nbeen endorsed because it is an important aid in developing new products properly \nand faster (Adler et al., 1996).",

The \nprocess control charts used for variables include the charts for the output mean \n(x-bar charts) and the output range (R-charts).\nIn the case of the measurement by attributes, the output units are classified as \naccepted or rejected, usually, by some form of inspection device that only distin -\nguishes between a \u201cgo\u201d or a \u201cno go\u201d situation. Rejects result from measurements \nfalling out of the range of acceptable values that are pre-set by design. Rejects are \ndefective product units. Under the attribute system of classification, process qual -\nity is judged by the number of defective units discovered by the pass\u2013fail test. \nIt is charted as the percentage of defects discovered in each sample and is called \na p-chart. Also under the attribute system of measurement is the c-chart, which \ncounts the number of nonconformities of a part. For example, in the eye of the \nspecialist, a particular diamond can be categorized as having various imperfections, \nwhich are counted. Distribution of the number of imperfections ( c) is the basis of \nthe c-chart.\nMonitoring by variables is more expensive than by attributes. The inspection \nby variables requires reading a scale and recording many numbers correctly (for \nexample, successive measurements of the weight of cans of peanuts that must be at \nleast 16 ounces). Measurement error must be avoided. A reading of 15.99 is unac -\nceptable whereas 16.01 is acceptable.

When error prevention is critical, assessment by attributes often is \nsafer. We should note that there is more information inherent in analysis of vari -\nables than in analysis of attributes which means that x-bar charts have greater sensi-\ntivity than p-charts to critical changes that signal fundamental system instabilities.\nInspection, whether by variables or attributes, leads to measurement of the \nquality of the process output. However, variability exists in all systems.

All of these result in higher profits. Evaluation \nof all jobs and workplaces along the supply chain will lead to layout improvements.\nThe paradigm used for such evaluations is like a balance scale or a seesaw.

This \ndescribes the opportunity cost trade-off model succinctly.\nImproving layout and job design involves opportunity costs trade-off analysis. \nOpportunity costs are the costs of doing less than the best. By doing something \nthat is not the best, the cost to be paid is the difference in net benefits. There are \nopportunity costs for not having the best possible layout design.\nThe equation for this trade-off model states that layout design improvement \nshould be made if:",

Thinking along these lines is not easily associated \nwith P/OM, which strives to meet the standards that are specified. That is why \nindustrial designers play a major role in product design decisions. There is broad \nsystems responsibility to achieve effective nonfunctional attributes for a product. \nThe Apple Industrial Design Group (IDG) was established in April 1977 by Steve \nJobs as an integral part of the company. There is an interesting history about how \nApple\u2019s \u201cuniform design language\u201d came into existence. However, designs are cre -\nated, P/OM is ultimately charged with making exactly what designers fashion.\nTimeliness is another elusive nonfunctional quality dimension. It is most evi -\ndent in the fashions and styles of clothing, athletic footwear, iTune downloads, and \nthe latest fad of youthful school-age market segments. The extent to which styles \ngo in and out of fashion is never overlooked by those who are in the seller\u2019s chair. \nIf vibrant laptop colors have real lasting power, the inventory of drab comput -\ners will have to be sold at a loss. Otherwise, there will be a glut of colored laptop \ncases. Managing inventories of home furnishings products requires an understand -\ning of the dynamics of style shifts. For example, the furniture suit business (e.g., \nThomasville) requires being on top of inventory shifts of types and colors of wood.\n8.3.1.6 The Variety Dimension\nMarketing can assist strategic planners in their evaluation of the importance of \nvariety of choice. Variety is defined as the number of product alternatives (in a given \nproduct class) that are made available to the customer. Variety can include different \nquality dimensions at different prices. The key to defining variety is that customers \nsee the various choices as substitutable alternatives.\nThe number of flavors that Jello offers is an illustration of variety as a qual -\nity. Does the customer want to buy green or red Jello? If green, will it be lime- or \nkiwi-flavored? In Brazil, it might be avocado-flavored. Having set down what the \ncustomer seems to want, what does P/OM have to do to switch the production line \nfrom green to red? How much does that cost? Will it be less expensive to switch \nfrom red to green? Answers to such questions are based on operational consider -\nations. For example, it is easier to switch from white to black paint than the reverse.\nVariety often increases a brand\u2019s market share because people like to switch \nflavors from time to time. They might switch away from their favored brand to get \na different flavor occasionally. Similarly, some people like white cars and other like \nred ones. A dealer with only one color car is likely to sell fewer cars. Variety of the \nproduct line is dependent upon process capabilities to shift inexpensively from one \ncolor, flavor, or size to another. Can different prices be charged for choices among \nvarieties? If it costs a lot to add another variant, customers must be willing to pay \nfor the additional choice, and that is a matter of price elasticity. For example, to get \ndecaffeinated coffee requires an extra step since the coffee beans contain caffeine \nnaturally.",

However, we will illustrate the impact of shifting resources \nover the project completion time.\nThe existence of slack is an important basis for resource leveling and scheduling. \nTo illustrate, consider Figures 7.1 (network) and 7.2 (list of all paths) which were \nobtained from the data given in Table 7.1. No resources were considered while doing \nthis analysis. Suppose a part of one of the resources, say a team of workers, is shifted \nfrom activity B to activity A. This may result in increasing the time of activity B, say \nby 1 week (to 6 weeks), and decreasing the time of activity A by 1 week (to 8 weeks). \nThe lengths of the four paths will now be: A\u2013D\u2013H\u2013I\u2013J (39), B\u2013E\u2013H\u2013I\u2013J (33), \nB\u2013F\u2013I\u2013J (26), and C\u2013G\u2013I\u2013J (32). Path A\u2013D\u2013H\u2013I\u2013J is still the critical path but \nits length is 39 weeks and hence the project duration has been reduced by 1 week. \nThis was accomplished by shifting resources from one activity to another rather \nthan spending more resources. Project manager and clients will be pleased. Leveling \nshould not be confused with crashing of activities that increases the cost. In addition, \ndue to a decrease in the length of critical path, slacks of individual activities will also \nchange. For example, the slack of activity B will become 7 weeks instead of 8 weeks.\nResource management provides the means to withdraw resources, shift \nresources, or to add new resources. This approach changes budgetary constraints. \nChanging the budget is a strategic decision. The tactical aspect of resource level -\ning is that it can affect the entire system without changing the budget. All project \nteam members are impacted when resources are shifted and they should be kept \ninformed of project alterations. Good resource-allocation decisions are a project-\nmanagement responsibility. This is another example of where tactical changes have \nfar-reaching impact on strategic issues.\nSummary\nChapter 7 starts by identifying project characteristics and explains the unique work \nconfigurations known as projects.

However, the strain of such repetitive \nwork has led to the conclusion that keying jobs on the computer are best redesigned \nto include a regular rest period every hour. Job design, work schedules, and job lay-\nout must be treated together as an integrated system to deal with this issue.\n10.10.2 Layout Types\nThere are at least six types of layouts that will be found in plants and offices. These are:\n 1.  Job shop process layouts . Similar types of equipment or jobs are grouped \ntogether. The lathes are in one place and the presses in another. For services, \nfiling is in one room and copy machines are in another. Inspectors are in \none place; designers are in another. Job shop process layouts should facilitate \nprocessing many different types of work in relatively small lots. Mobility of \nequipment enables P/OM to set up intermittent flow shops when that con -\nfiguration is attainable. Space must be allocated for work completed at one \nstation and waiting for access to another station. Equipment mobility and \nlayout flexibility allow this configuration to be rearranged to suit the various \norder mixtures that can occur.\n 2. Product-oriented layout . This layout is typical of the flow shop. Equipment \nand transport systems are arranged to make the product as efficiently as pos -\nsible. The layout is designed to prohibit disruptions to the flow. The product-\noriented layout is most often associated with assembly lines.\n 3.  Cellular layout . This layout is used with a team of people and machines work-\ning together to produce a dedicated family of parts, as in group technology. \nThe layout is engineered to facilitate efficient transfer of work between sta -\ntions in the cell. Setup and transfer are programmed by the system for fast \nchangeovers that enable small runs of a limited number of parts or items.\n 4. Group technology layout . GT layout is used to efficiently produce families of \nparts without emphasis on computer programming controls as in cellular lay-\nouts. Layout is based on the advantage of having similarity of design features.\n 5.  Combinations of product and process  orientation are very common. Some of \nthe products in the job shop achieve demand volumes that allow them to be \nrun for long periods of time as intermittent flow shops. Modular product-\ndesigned parts often have the high volumes that allow cellular manufacture \nor group technology layouts with, in some cases, serialized flow shop advan -\ntages. At the same time, other jobs in the shop remain at low volumes that \nare only suited to the process layout of job shops. The combination produces \na mixed-layout orientation, which is also called a hybrid layout.\n 6. Fixed-position (or static) layout . In this layout the product does not move. \nThe machines, materials and people are brought to the product. Examples \ninclude, shipbuilding and a skyscraper like Burj Khalifa in Dubai.",

This results in 87 units being backordered and they must \nbe carried over into April\u2019s demand. Thus, the demand in April is 396 and the 87 \nbackordered units must be added to 396 yielding 483 units.

Then to produce 600 complete \ntest kit units in 22 days,\nProduction level per day = 600/22 = 27.27: The fractional result can be \ninterpreted in various ways. It can be rounded down and treated as waste. \nAlternatively, it can be completed using overtime. We treat a production level \nof 27.27 as producing 27 test kit units on that given day; production will \ncontinue to work on unfinished product on the following day.\nNumber of workers required: The number of workers required on any given \nday is a function of the production for that day, the number of hours worked \non that day, and the production time (time required to produce one unit).\nNumber of workers = (production \u00d7 production time per unit)/hours worked\nIn March, suppose each worker works for 8 h per day and the produc -\ntion time is 4 h per testing kit (unit). To achieve a production output level \nof 27.27, the required number of workers is: (27.27 \u00d7 4)/8 = 13.64.

With a \nlarge value of \u03b1, the bona fide changes will be reflected immediately in the new \naverage.\nIt is difficult to say beforehand which value of \u03b1 will serve the purpose best. \nDifferent values of \u03b1 starting with a small value may be chosen to make a forecast. \nThe actual observed data and the forecast using different values of \u03b1 may be plot-\nted on a graph and by examination that value of \u03b1 which tracks the actual demand \nbest is chosen.

Fighter aircraft \nuse ES to aim their guns at moving targets. In effect, they forecast the location of \nenemy jets during flying missions. This application shows how fast the ES method \ncan track a consistent, but dynamically changing pattern. Manufacturers use ES to \nforecast demand levels, which experience the same kind of nonrandom but volatile \nshifts from time to time. In such cases, the recent past has the most information \nabout the near future. ES can catch these shifts and make rapid adjustments to \ninventory levels. Other manufacturers and service organizations use it because it \nrequires less computational work and is readily understood.\n3.3.4 Forecasting with a Seasonal Cycle\nForecasting when seasonality is present can be done by assuming that what hap -\npened last year (or last month, etc.) will happen again. We call it the historical \nforecast method. The pattern is expected to repeat itself within the time period. \nThis method works if a stable pattern (which is often seasonal) exists. The hotel \nand resort business is typically involved with historical forecasts, as is the agricul -\nture business. In each case, special circumstances can arise that lead to the desire \nto modify the historical forecast. In the case of hotels and resorts, the state of the \neconomy can modify the ups and downs of occupancy rates. Agricultural pursuits \nare modified by rainfalls and temperature fluctuations (see modifications to the \nhistorical forecast in the sections that follow).\nWhen last year\u2019s monthly sales values are used to predict the next year\u2019s monthly \nsales values, the method is based on using past history to forecast. The same concept \napplies to weekly or daily sales, which can be forecast on a semiannual, quarterly,",

In job analysis con -\nducted by HR professionals, it is common to use more than one of these \nmethods.\nFor example, the job analysts may tour the job site and observe work -\ners performing their jobs. During the tour, the analyst may collect mate -\nrials that directly or indirectly indicate required skills (duty statements, \ninstructions, safety manuals, quality charts, etc.).\nThe analyst may then meet with a group of workers or incumbents. And, \nfinally, a survey may be administered. In these cases, job analysts typically \nare industrial psychologists or have been trained by, and are acting under \nthe supervision of, an industrial psychologist.\nIn the context of vocational rehabilitation, the primary method is \ndirect observation and may even include video recordings of incum -\nbents involved in the work.

Delays in production of the new product can cripple the solo-product \nrollover by exhausting supplies of the old product before new product replacements \ncan begin to satisfy demand.\nPreparation for the solo-product rollover involves having the replacement prod-\nuct ready to go to market. A good analogy is how runners pass their relay-race \nbaton. It is critical to pass the baton without delay. In effect, the old product has \ndone its job. The new product takes over. Proper timing is vital. The new product is \na replacement\u2014not a line extension. As a swap it does not have the burden of going \nthrough Stages 1 and 2 of Figure 3.10. The new product is designed to enjoy the \nmature stability of Stage 3\u2014even though the interval of stability has been decreas -\ning markedly in the past decade (Billington et al., 1998). There are many failures. \nThe legacy market share of the old product may not be transferable to the new \nproduct. That legacy is not automatically renewable. The joint plans of marketing \nand production must be innovative to enjoy success.\nIn the dual-product rollover situation, it is necessary to achieve the right bal -\nance of price for the trade-off in attributes, so that new product demand does not \ncannibalize demand for the old product. Communication between marketing and \nproduction is crucial\u2014but will not suffice without a carefully thought out plan. The \nplan must consider all contingencies. Expectations should be detailed beforehand \nand results monitored after the new product has been introduced. The perils of \ninept market research can lead to strategic marketing blunders. Production failures \ncan lead to customer dissatisfaction and switching to the products of competitors. \nThe effects of cannibalization can be disastrous. The business model analysis for \ndual-product rollovers must be based on anticipating the real behaviors of customer.\nWhen done properly, line extensions have an opposite effect from cannibaliza -\ntion, that is, the total share of A ( SA) and A\u2019 (SA\u2019) is larger than that of the original \nshare of A alone. A is also better able to fend off competition. These two points \nare the underlying purposes of the dual-product rollover.

This is accomplished by assuming \na larger (worse case) average than the actual average for the LT. To illustrate, if LT \nis known to average 10 days, and it is also known to range \u00b12 days almost all of \nthe time, then an estimate of 12 days for LT might be a self-protective move. Extra \ninventory would be carried to buffer the 2 days that LT might slip. Airlines add \nextra minutes to their flight schedules to reduce the regularly reported frequency \nof being late.

That number of units, called the RP, triggers an order for \nmore stock to be placed with the appropriate supplier. OPP models specify the \nnumber of units to order. The time between orders varies depending on the order \nquantity and the rate at which demand depletes the stock on-hand. So, order size \nis fixed and the interval between orders varies. This discussion is about one type of \norder point system called the perpetual inventory system. It continuously records \ninventory withdrawals. Most often it is used online and in real time.\nNext, another type of OPP will be described. It is called a periodic inventory \nsystem. On consecutive specific dates separated by the same amount of time, the \nitem\u2019s record is called up and an order is placed for a variable number of units. The \norder size is determined by the amount of stock on hand when the record is read. \nIt is the date that triggers the review and the order being placed. Therefore, in the \nperiodic case, the interval between orders is fixed while the ordered amount varies. \nThe order amount is a function of the rate at which demand occurred in the period \nbetween reviews of the item\u2019s records.\nPeriodic OPP has become outmoded in some companies because computer sys-\ntems enable the perpetual inventory system to be used inexpensively. The perpetual \nsystem has advantages that will be explained. Nevertheless, the periodic system will \nbe described for two reasons. First, it is used to order certain items together from \nthe same supplier.\nThis may be done by small- and medium-sized organizations to obtain carload \nfreight rates because they do not have sufficient volume to fill a freight car with one \nitem.

New accounting methods, called \nactivity-based costing (ABC), should be used to improve overhead account -\ning. A good introduction to ABC can be found in Kaplan and Cooper (1988) \nand Kaplan and Anderson (2007). Operations managers need to discuss \nthese issues with their colleagues from accounting.\n 4. The systems approach requires communication between functions and the \nsharing of what used to be (and still are, in many traditional firms) mutu -\nally exclusive databases. The databases of marketing and sales, P/OM, R&D, \nengineering, and finance are cross-linked when advantageous. This sharing is \ncrucial to enabling the systems approach to work. There are many examples of \nboth manufacturing and service industries where shared databases have been \ninstalled and utilized successfully.\n 5.

It is a good bet that the taxonomy of the twenty-first \ncentury will categorize production as a subheading under operations, and services \nwill be an integral part of manufacturing. Inter-functional planning with shared \ninformation will be the norm and not the exception.\nWhen a discussion applies equally well to both manufacturing and services, it is \noften referred to as P/OM. As explained earlier, it is increasingly common to call it \nOM. However, in this book, we will use the terms P/OM and OM interchangeably. \nBecause we are straddling the 20th and 21st centuries, we tend to use P/OM most \noften. We do so to be as inclusive as possible.\n1.7 Defining Operations\nOperations are purposeful actions (or activities) methodically done as part of a \nplan of work by a process that is designed to achieve practical ends and concrete \nobjectives. This definition is applicable to both manufacturing and services orga -\nnizations. This interpretation further justifies the use of the term operations for \nmanufacturing. An operations manager is responsible for planning, organizing, \ncoordinating, and controlling organizational resources to produce desired goods \nand services, which is the subject matter of this textbook.\n1.7.1 Manufacturing Operations\nManufacturing operations transform materials into desired goods and products. \nOperations can be described using different verbs and object phrases such as pressing",

The flexibility concept joins computers and equipment of \nmany other kinds, including assembly-line processes and office machines. It is also \npossible and often desirable to include human beings in the network. Flexibility \ncan be applied to information systems\u2014flexible information systems and to flexible \noffice systems as well as to FMS.\nFlexibility in the office leads to consideration of telecommuting. That name is \nnot properly descriptive of the effort to cut down on office space by having office \nemployees work some part of the time at home or at a satellite office nearer to their \nplace of residence. Thus, in addition to saving money by having smaller offices, \npeople do not have to spend hours in traffic commuting to work. There are other \nadvantages including having quiet time to concentrate. However, there is the oppo-\nsite effect of not being able to focus on work because of distractions at home. Also \nthe telephone is not a substitute for eye-to-eye contact with coworkers.

For example, there \nis exact duplication which is characteristic of the flow shop in which statistically \nhomogeneous replicas are turned out (one after another). On the other hand, generic \nrepetitiveness is the property of flexible flow shops that allow certain changes to be \nmade such as (three color varieties: green or blue or red stripes\u2014depending on \norders on hand) without requiring new setups of the system. This capability in the \nfactory, called mass customization, can apply to many service systems including \noffices and restaurants.\nMass customization capabilities to produce small numbers of many varieties \ninclude extensive application of systems thinking to integrate marketing needs and \nP/OM scheduling abilities. Using marketing forecasts, P/OM managers decide \nwhat to make, but the decisions are constrained by the FMS menu, which was \npredetermined at the initial planning stage.\nThe need to produce increased variety is market-driven. The transformation \nprocess has to be able to change over from making one thing to another, quickly \nand inexpensively. A great deal of effort goes into altering the transformation pro -\ncess, so it can deal with the goal of increased variety.

Traveling many miles for sun and surf, or for snow \nand skiing, the service starts with the airline providing transportation. Then the \nhotel or resort offers food, shelter, sports, and entertainment.\nFacilities planning and management are crucial to success in the hotel and \nresort business. Location may be at the top of the list. Services, in general, are \nstrongly affected by location, structure, site, equipment, and layout because they all \nparticipate in making contact with customers successful.\nGovernment institutions locate services close to the citizens who need them. \nMunicipal governments provide police and fire protection to those who live within \nthe municipality and pay the taxes. License plates for boats and cars are obtained \nat the state tag offices in many states. Hard liquor can only be obtained at state-\nrun stores in many monopoly or control states. Effective federal service requires \nregional offices. For example, at the federal level there are offices for Veterans \nAffairs, Food & Drug Administration, the Agricultural Department, the Labor \nDepartment, and the ubiquitous U.S. Post Offices.\n10.4.2 Just-in-Time Orientation\nExtractors like to be close to their raw materials. Historically, at breakeven, gold \nmining reduces a ton of ore to 4.5 grams of gold. Profitable mines need to have ore \nthat reduces to more than 4.5 g of gold. This assumes that competent P/OM con -\ntrols the costs of extracting tons of earth and reducing these tons to grams of gold \nore. It makes sense for the reduction process to be as near to the mines as possible. \nThe price of gold on world markets plays a part. When the price of gold is high, the \nbreakeven point is lower than 4.5 g. Mines can make a profit because each gram of \ngold fetches a higher price.",

Also, it was decided to use a p-chart as the simplest way to demonstrate the \nimportance of the acquisition of the new molding machine.\nLet us assume that previously, a defective product was defined as a box of truffles \nthat weighed less than a pound. What was in the box was allowed to vary, as long as \nthe pound constraint was met. Now the idea is to control defectives on each piece\u2019s \nweight. The new definition of a reject is as follows: A defective occurs when weight of \na chocolate <29.60 g or weight of a chocolate >30.40 g. This standard set on pieces is \nmore stringent than the earlier one set on box weight. The new standards will always \nsatisfy BCTF\u2019s criteria to deliver nothing less than a pound box of chocolate.\nIt has been suggested that the data of Table 8.3 be tested against the p-chart \ncriteria. Rejects are marked with an R in Table 8.4.\nThe number of rejects (NR) is counted, and p is calculated for each subgroup, \np = number of rejects/sample size. See Table 8.4. For example, for the 10:00 A.M. \nsample, the number of rejects is 1 and the sample size is 4. Therefore, p = 0.25. The \nvalues of p are 0.50, 0.25, 0.75, and 0.25 for samples II, III, IV, and V, respectively. \nThe average number of rejects ( p-bar) is 0.40 = (0.25 + 0.50 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25)\n/5. The value of p-bar could have been calculated by dividing the total number of \nrejects (8) by the total number inspected (20). The total number inspected is number \nof days (4) * number of samples (5).\nThe p-chart requires the calculation of the standard deviation \u03c3 which is given \nby the following formula:\n \ns = \u2212() () .pp\nn\n1\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n10 A.M. 11 A.M. 1 P.M.\nHours of day\n3 P.M. 4 P.M.\nLCL = 0.00\nR = 1.00\nUCL = 2.28\nR\nFigure 8.13 The three-sigma limits R-chart for Belgian Chocolate Truffle Factory \n(BCTF).",

It is intended for those students who want to understand \nthe way in which equilibrium calculations are obtained. These calculations which \nuse the data in Table 11.2 are straight-forward. There are three equations and only \ntwo variables, viz., share of A (S A) and share of B\u2019 (S B\u2019).

Using this condition, Equation \n11.1 becomes:\n 0 = \u22120.5*SA + 0.6*SB\u2019 (11.4)\nOr:\n 0.5*S A = 0.6*SB\u2019 (11.5)\nSo:\n S A = 6/5(SB\u2019) = 1.2 SB\u2019 (11.6)\nBy incorporating this result into Equation (11.3), we obtain:\n 100  = 1.2 SB\u2019 + SB\u2019 = 2.2 SB\u2019 (11.7)\nThus:\n S B\u2019 = 100/2.2 = 45.4545455 (11.8)",

The probabilities of completing \nall paths by the due date are also given in Table 7.10. The probability of completing \nthe project by the due date is assumed to be the probability of completing the criti-\ncal path by the due date. For this example, the probability of completing the project \nin 36 weeks is 0.753.

The fundamental \nidea of resource management is to switch extra resources from places where they are \nnot essential to places where they could be used immediately. Alternatively, resource \nmanagement aims to balance resource assignments across activities over time. It also \nprovides some control for time-based management of project life cycles and facilitates \nshortening the critical path. It is a method for improving the speed of project achieve-\nments. It can also help improve quality of achievements and then rapid attainment.\nResource management seeks to move people from overstaffed activities to those \nthat are understaffed. It attempts to reallocate money from where there is over -\nspending to where there is under-spending. These efforts must make sense in tech -\nnological and process terms. Similarly, the project manager would prefer smooth \ndemand for cash instead of sporadic cash outflows. If, among a set of simultaneous \nactivities, a few are receiving the greatest percentage of project expenditures, it \noften is desirable to level these allocations.\nThe beginning game is thoughtful and deliberate. The design of many projects \nis such that they start slowly while many ideas are being considered. There is much \nslack in activities that are off the critical path as reports are written and approvals \nare sought. There seems no need for urgency. The critical path is itself stretched out \nby bureaucratic organization of the project. This point of view has been undergoing \nchange because of competitive pressures.\nThe end game has everything coming to a head very quickly. The end game \nhas a time deadline that begins to appear to be looming. Then, it is decided that \ntime must be made up. There is a surge in spending to speed up the project. \nOften, in the rush, mistakes are made, and damage control uses up time that \nwas meant for thoughtful and deliberate means to bring the project to a success -\nful conclusion. It is well known to project managers that this type of pattern is",

This \nprocess design aspect of P/OM is based on strong linkages to product design. The \ngoal culmination is the responsibility of both marketing and P/OM working closely \ntogether\u2014the appropriate idiom is\u2014hand in glove.\nFor proper coordination of functions we need to keep in mind that marketing \nand P/OM use different lingos. It is understandable that managers of P/OM and \nmarketing have hurdles that must be overcome to cooperate fully in every aspect of \nthe transitions from original designs to new ones. Strong interactions are necessary \nto deal competently with all NPD projects.\nDecisions made by both marketing and P/OM must be shared in a transparent \nenvironment to achieve organizational success. Forecasting is often done separately \nby both marketing and P/OM. This is unacceptable. Forecasting responsibilities must \nbe shared. Differences in P/OM and marketing expectations must be explained \nleading to acceptance of a common vision. Other aspects of coordination, includ -\ning the critical importance of teamwork, will be addressed later on in this chapter.\n11.2 Organizations Must Be Adaptable\nSuccess as defined by organizations dedicated to making a profit for their share -\nholders is measurably different from success defined by not-for-profit organizations. \nFor example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) succeed \nwhen disease is eliminated and good health is pervasive. For example, benefits (not \nprofits) describe goals of the Red Cross, OXFAM, and The Salvation Army. On \nthe other hand, profits define the goals of airlines, banks, computer manufacturers, \nhotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and cable companies.\nAt this stage in the text, every student should be able to define financial suc -\ncess as it applies to profit-making organizations. Defining successful innovations \nfor non-profit organizations is more difficult. Often it means that costs have been \nreduced without any detrimental effect on services provided. Less tangible measures \nof what constitutes improved benefits need evaluations of services offered, and these \ncan be viewed differently by various constituencies (e.g., different demographic seg-\nments). In spite of this problem, there is general agreement that innovations can \nprovide a means to success for both profit and not-for-profit organizations.",

Within that group, there are cer -\ntain subgroups that handle high frequency requests with flow shop dedication. \nSixty percent of the complaints can be treated in the highly repetitive fashion. The \nremaining 40% require special treatment for customer satisfaction. The analogy \ncan be extended to families of complaint types and the use of group technology \nprocess layout.\nVolvos are manufactured in Sweden on fixed platforms. The work does not \nmove. Workers move to the platform and around it. Similarly, shipbuilders and \nhomebuilders move around the work. Modular housing exemplifies hybrid layout \nwhere the parts are made in a factory and then brought to the site where they are \nassembled, similar to Volvos.\nWith fixed platforms, workers carry or drive their tools to where they are \nneeded. Commercial airplanes are moved along a production line, albeit slowly. \nCommercial air-line layout is a different form of hybrid, one that combines fixed \nand moving positions. The fixed-position layout is necessary for power plants, refin-\neries, and locomotives. It is much more controversial in the Volvo case which shall \nbe explained below.\nVolvo uses the fixed platform because Swedish workers find it more interesting \nto participate in building the whole car than doing a repetitive step along an assem-\nbly line. Worker motivation is improved because they all meet together around \nthe platform. This is in contrast to assembly line work where each station is indi -\nvidual and relatively isolated. In Sweden, worker motivation is important because \nunemployment benefits are a large percentage of earned wages and readily available. \nBored workers are likely to prefer the government benefits to the company wages.\nThe United Auto Workers (UAW) arranged an interesting experiment in which \na group of GM workers were given the opportunity to work with Volvo for six \nmonths. Most of these workers said they preferred to work on the GM flow shop \nassembly layout in spite of, and because of, its repetitive nature. The Volvo lay -\nout required knowing and doing too many things. A few of the GM workers pre -\nferred the Volvo system and they remained with Volvo. The rest (and it was most) \nreturned to Detroit.\nGroup technology (GT) for families of parts is a layout that many companies, \nsuch as Caterpillar, John Deere, and Cummins Engine, have found rewarding. GT \ncells are usually part of hybrid layouts. The group technology concept uses a prod -\nuct layout with the capability of producing an entire family of parts. Think about \nhow clothing manufacturers size their clothes; paint manufacturers fill quart and \ngallons cans; shoemakers size their shoes.\nSpecial equipment is required that has rapid changeover capabilities to make \nparts that are identical except for size and/or other dimensional characteristics. \nCrankshafts, motors, and pumps are typical parts for GT. The production cells \nuse flexible machine-tool organization. Group technology layout is usually a self-\ncontained part of a process layout job shop.",

First, the ideal system for a given application is \noften a noncausal system, which although not physically possible, can give \ninsight into the design of a derivated causal system to accomplish a similar \npurpose. Second, there are instances when a system does not operate in \n\u201creal time\u201d but rather is simulated \u201coffline\u201d by a computer.\nAnalog systems with memory may be further classified as lumped or \ndistributed. The difference can be explained by considering the meaning \nof memory in a system. Future output of a system with memory depends \non future input and a number of state variables, such as values of the input \nor output at various times in the past. If the number of state variables \nnecessary to describe future output is finite, the system is lumped; if it is \ninfinite, the system is distributed.\nFinally, systems may be characterized by certain properties which  \nfacilitate their analysis:\nA system is linear if it has superposition and scaling properties.\nA system that is not linear is nonlinear.\nIf the output of a system does not depend explicitly on time, the system \nis said to be time-invariant; otherwise, it is time-variant,\nA system that will always produce the same output for a given input is \nsaid to be deterministic.\nA system that will produce different outputs for a given input is said to \nbe stochastic.\nThere are many methods of analysis developed specifically for linear \ntime-invariant (LTI) deterministic systems. Unfortunately, in the case \nof analog systems, none of these properties are ever perfectly achieved. \nLinearity implies that operation of a system can be scaled to arbitrarily \nlarge magnitudes, which is not possible. Time-invariance is violated by \naging effects that can change the outputs of analog systems over time \n(usually years or even decades). Thermal noise and other random phe -\nnomena ensure that the operation of any analog system will have some \ndegree of stochastic behavior. Despite these limitations, however, it is \nusually reasonable to assume that deviations from these ideals will be \nsmall.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Manufacturing is the fabrication and assembly of goods, whereas \nservices generate revenues either independent of goods or to help the user of those \ngoods. Banking, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment are all services. \nThey change the customer\u2019s location, financial condition, and sense of well-being. \nIncreasingly, manufacturers recognize the importance of servicing customers, and \nservice systems recognize the value of using manufacturing capabilities.\nSimilarities between services and manufacturing can be noted when service \noperations are based on repetitive steps in information processing. Almost identical \nmethods apply with respect to production scheduling, job design and design of the \nworkplace, process configurations, and quality achievement. High-volume repetitive \noperations on physical items (i.e., for fast foods or blood testing) constitute produc-\ntion irrespective of whether they are categorized as manufacturing or services.

In Europe, the \nnotion of leanness was directly associated with speeding up cycle times and project \ndevelopment times. At one time, half-time systems were advanced by Saab. The \ngoal was to cut in half the time currently required to do any operation. However, \ntoo little, too late, Saab was not lean enough. It ceased production in 2011 and \npetitioned the Swedish court for bankruptcy. Talks continue about restarting \nproduction.\nMany US organizations have adopted at least some aspects of lean and rapid \nmanufacturing methods. Six Sigma, when properly conceived and executed, is a \nmeans to LPS. Motorola\u2019s management originally set itself the goal of reducing \ndefectives to less than 3.4 defects per million parts. This is called the six-sigma \nprogram. Having demonstrated that near-zero defect rates are attainable, Motorola \nnow has set another radical target, which is to reduce existing cycle times by 90%. \nThis means that a part that currently takes 10 minutes to produce eventually \nwill be made in 1 minute. Note the Saab half-time objective mentioned earlier. \nHighlighting reduced cycle-time objectives brings new features to the production \ntransformation process. However, wishing does not make it so. Goals that are unat-\ntainable can be more destructive than helpful.\nThe next two steps are in formative stages, and their impact on productivity \ncannot be fully evaluated at this time.\n2.5.7  Mass Customization with CAD, CAM, and Flexible \nProduction System\u2014P/OM\u2019s Sixth Step\nCAD that is able to program flexible production machinery represents powerful \nnew technological capabilities.

That defines mass customization as a stream of custom -\nized items, each unique within a set of design parameter constraints, produced in \nminimum time and cost per unit. The idea of mass customization is elusive because \nthere are so few examples of this kind of process. A few good ones follow.\nIt is not difficult to imagine the mass production process to produce coins such \nas pennies, nickels, dimes, or quarters. The disk is blanked out of the appropriate \nmetal sheet. The blanking dies corrugate (called reeding) the edge of the dime and \nquarter. This process also forms two rims (one circles the outside of the obverse face \nand the other circles the reverse [tail\u2019s] side). It is a systems factor to note that the \nrim aids blind people in distinguishing between different coins. If that fact is lost, a \nnew manager hire might aspire to save money by removing the rimming.\nThe coin is imprinted on both sides. Rough edges are polished (flash trimmed). \nMillions of dimes can be run at one time, but to make quarters, the dime-mak -\ning process must be stopped. The materials and dies have to be changed. Before \nrestarting the process flow, the set-up system includes: stopping, taking-down, \ncleaning-up, setting-up, and restarting the process flow; that is the essence of mass \nproduction.\nMass customization, on the other hand, allows the orders to be filled (for bank \ndemands) without having excessive production that requires lots of storage until \ncoins are distributed for use. Upon demand for a specific coin\u2014within seconds\u2014\nthe production process accesses the appropriate material, uses the proper dies, \ntrimmers, and transports the product from raw material to finished items. This \nprocess can switch back-and-forth with no clean-up, take-down, start-up, and no \nloss of time.\nThe mass customization process is as economic to run (per unit made) as the \nmass production process. The advantage is that \u201cyou run what you need.\u201d There \nis no inventory with its idle value-added being put into storage. However, as Paul \nZipkin points out, the investment in mass customization equipment (i.e., able to \nshift without set-up costs between pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters) is much \ngreater (Zipkin, 2001). Therefore, straight-forward business analysis must be \nused to determine when mass customization is a good deal. For the US Treasury \nDepartment, elicitation, process flexibility, and delivery logistics are all likely to be \nsupportive of a \u201cgo for it\u201d decision. See Readers\u2019 Choice at the start of this chapter \nfor a definition of elicitation.\nPPP permits mass customization of product by demographic segments (e.g., \nDell, HP, Ford, GM, and Toyota can configure the product that you want). On the \nother hand, The Campbell Soup Company, using mass production, cannot deliver \na can of soup that meets the specifications of a customer who wants no more than \n50 mg of sodium. Regular chicken noodle soup from many brands has 890 mg of \nsodium which is exceedingly high for people required to have a low sodium diet. \nThe market is growing for low-sodium products of many kinds.\nCampbell\u2019s low sodium chicken noodle soup has 90 mg of sodium. With enough \ndemand at the 90-sodium level, Campbell will use large runs that approximate",

The buyer will prefer to have a lower value of c because for \na given p it reduces the probability of accepting the lot whereas a supplier will prefer \na large value of c. A supplier does not want the lot to be rejected.\nThe acceptance number c has a big effect on the probability of acceptance as \ndiscussed above.\nThe other controlling parameter is n. The larger the value of n, the more dis -\ncriminating is the sampling plan. The sample size n drives the value of the prob -\nability of acceptance. The effect of N is not great except when the value of N is quite \nsmall. The selection of sample size is based on statistical considerations (not dis -\ncussed in this chapter). However, it may be mentioned that it has been established \nthat OC curves with the same sampling proportion ( n/N ratio) do not provide the \nsame probability of acceptance. They are not even similar OC curves.\nDesigning a sampling plan requires determining what the values of the probabil-\nity of acceptances should be for different levels of p. This is to provide the kind of \nprotection that both the supplier and the buyer agree upon. Then, the OC curve can \nbe constructed by choosing appropriate values for n and c. Note that an agreement is \nrequired. The design is not the unilateral decision of the buyer alone. The situation calls \nfor compromise and negotiation between the supplier and the buyer. A sampling plan \nthat minimizes the cost of inspection and gives the desired results needs to be designed.\n8.11.2 Multiple-Sampling Plans\nMultiple-sampling plans are utilized when the cost of inspection required by the \nsingle-sampling plan is too great. Single-sampling plans require that the decision \nto accept or reject the lot must be made on the basis of the first sample drawn. \nWith double sampling, a second sample is drawn if needed. Double sampling is \nused when it can lower inspection costs. The double-sampling plan requires two \nacceptance numbers c1 and c2 such that c2 > c1. Then, if the observed number of \ndefectives in the first sample of size n1 is d1:\nAccept the lot if d1 \u2264 c1.\nReject the lot if d1 > c2.\nIf c1 < d1 \u2264 c2, then draw an additional sample of size n2.\nThe total sample is now of size n1 +  n2; and the total number of defectives \nfrom the double sample is now d1 + d2. Then the decision rule is\nAccept the lot if (d1 + d2) \u2264 c2.\nReject the lot if (d1 + d2)> c2.\nDouble sampling saves money by hedging. The first sample, which is small, is tested \nby a strict criterion of acceptability. Only if it fails are the additional samples taken. \nDouble-sampling costs have to be balanced against the costs of the single large sample.",

That variability is \nsaid to be caused by chance causes (also called simple causes). These causes cannot \nbe removed from the system, which is why they are called inherent systems causes. \nThey are also called chance causes because they are predictable and stable in statis -\ntical terms, as are the number of heads from an honest coin throw. A process that \nexperiences only chance causes, no matter what its level of variability, is called a \nstable process. The variability that it experiences is called random variation.\n8.6.2.2 Assignable Causes\nThe second kind of variability has traceable and removable causes, which are called \nassignable or special causes. Unlike chance causes, these causes are not background \nnoise. They produce a distinct trademark, which can be identified and traced to its \norigins. They are called assignable because these causes can be designated as to type \nand source, and removed.\nThe process manager identifies the sources of quality disturbances\u2014a tool that \nhas shifted, a gear tooth that is chipped, an operator who is missing the mark, an \ningredient that is too acidic\u2014and does what is required to correct the situation. \nThus, tool, die, and gear wear is correctable.\nBroken conveyor drives can be replaced. Vibrating loose parts can be tightened. \nHuman errors in machine setups can be remedied. These are examples of assignable \ncauses that can be detected by the methods of SPC. An alternative name that might \nbe preferred to assignable causes is identifiable systems causes.\n8.6.3 What Are QC Charts?\nQC charts are the means for plotting the quality of the process output measured \nthrough inspection whether by variables or attributes. QC charts can spot identifi -\nable causes of system variation. Once identified, knowledge of the process leads to \nthe cause, which is then removed so that the process can return to its basic, inherent \ncauses of variability. To construct a control chart we must find the mean and the \nstandard deviation of the process output. We will use the symbol \u00b5 for the mean and \n\u03c3 for the standard deviation in all our discussions in this chapter. Suppose we are \nproducing steel rods. The diameter of the rods is the variable of interest and defines \nthe quality of the output. To construct the control chart, we calculate the mean (aver-\nage) diameter and the standard deviation of the process output. The methods to find \nmean and standard deviation depend on the type of chart and will be discussed later.\nIn a control chart, the Y-axis represents the observed process output measured \nat successive intervals (or for successive samples) and the X-axis represents the time \ninterval (or successive sample numbers).

Person-to-person activities that require transfer \nof information and/or treatments offered by one to another are difficult to sched -\nule; activity times vary more than with machines. Human-to-human interactions \ninvolve many more intangibles than interactions between people and machines. \nThe contact aspect of services requires different methods for analysis and synthesis \nthan are needed for manufacturing systems.\nAt the same time, care should be taken to avoid stereotyping services as being \nall too human and, therefore, difficult to control for quality and productivity. It \ndoes a disservice to services to consider them quixotic or flawed by humanism, \nwhile manufacturing is admired for its elegant, efficient technological component. \nA most respected thinker, Levitt (1972) has written, \u201cUntil we think of service \nin more positive and encompassing terms, until it is enthusiastically viewed as \nmanufacturing in the field, receptive to the same kind of technological approaches \nthat are used in the factory, the results are likely to be \u2026 costly and idiosyncratic.\u201d\nThe point to make is that services that are currently rendered in an inherently \ninefficient way often can be transformed into rational repeatable activities that \nemulate the best of manufacturing environments. However, often is not always. \nSome services are not amenable to the concept of manufacturing in the field. One \nmight be fearful if the services rendered by a doctor were based on a repetitive \nmanufacturing model. At the same time, many aspects of open-heart surgery are \nthe better for such systematization. The same can be said for blood testing, taking \nX-rays, and other repetitious aspects of the healthcare business. Juxtaposed to this, \nsome products, such as artwork, are epitomized by being custom-made. They lose \nmost of their value if they are manufactured.\nAnother significant difference between the provision of services and manufac -\nturing occurs because of inventory. It is not considered possible, usually, to stock \nservices. For example, when the machine-repairing person is idle, there is no way to \nbuild up an inventory of repair hours that can be used when two machines go down \nat the same time. In most service businesses, supply being greater than demand is \none of the great waste factors.\nOn the other hand, many companies use automated systems to provide cus -\ntom-tailored information such as stock, bond, and mutual fund quotes for anyone \nknowing the symbols. Phone-call requests for product information are answered by \na digitized voice that instructs the caller to use a Touch-Tone phone to input the \nproduct of interest and his or her fax number. The appropriate fax is automatically \ntransmitted within a minute. This entire service transaction, without human inter -\nvention, is becoming increasingly common and epitomizes automated manufactur-\ning and/or service processes. In this case, the supply of service hours is limited only \nby the technology and there is no cost for supply waiting for demand.\nVoice recognition technology is getting so good that a new era is about to occur \nthat will likely revolutionize the service function. Contacts by computer have \nbecome kindly and comfortable to customers. Machine\u2019s ability to understand",

Production/operations is a big umbrella that always includes services and \noften includes manufacturing.\nP/OM is the systematic planning, execution, and control of operations. \nThis definition implies that management is needed to ensure that actions are \n purposeful\u2014designed to achieve practical goals and targets. P/OM makes sure \nthat the work is done methodically, that is, characterized by method and order. The \nfact that a process is used suggests the presence of management to install a proce -\ndure for working systematically.\nOperations management is responsible for a plan of work\u2014a thoughtful pro -\ngression from one step to another. Plans require details for accomplishing work. \nThese details are often called the tactics of the plan. Practical ends are not realized \nwithout operations management that is able to provide strategies and tactics for \npublic service objectives, which can include the ability to gain market share on a \nbus route or participation in a recycling plan. Everyone wants to be able to gain \nmarket share. Strangely, the same does not apply to profit. Non-profit organizations \npay salaries and provide services which are profits transformed\u2014always labeled as \nexpenditures. There is a need to review why some organizations consider it embar -\nrassing to make a profit.\nOperations management uses methodology that consists of procedures, rules \nof thumb, and algorithms for analyzing situations and setting policies. They apply \nto many different kinds of service and manufacturing processes. In brief, opera -\ntions management consists of tactics such as scheduling work, assigning resources \nincluding people and equipment, managing inventories, assuring quality standards, \nprocess-type decisions that include capacity decisions, maintenance policies, equip-\nment selection, worker-training options, and the sequence for making individual \nitems in a product-mix set.",

It is unlikely that an \nexisting P/OM organization can skip a stage. Only with total reorganization is it \npossible for a Stage I company to become a Stage III or IV company. Reengineering \n(REE), which is defined as starting from scratch to redesign a system, is an appeal -\ning way to circumvent bureaucratic arthritis and jump stages. However, it is costly \nand, if not done right, has a high risk of failure. Mastery of this P/OM text will \nlower that risk.\n1.16  Organizational Positions and Career \nOpportunities in P/OM\nTo qualify for an operations management job, there are several reasons it helps \nto have an undergraduate degree in business or an MBA. First, P/OM is at the \nhub of the business model. This requires an understanding of the various func -\ntional business partners to achieve successful strategic planning. Second, there are \nmany concepts to learn and a special P/OM language to master. A single, introduc-\ntory course in P/OM will not suffice. The system\u2019s perspective is instrumental for \nsuccess. This requires knowledge about the various business functions including \nmarketing, finance, accounting, and human resources management. Vice versa, a \nmarketing career is enhanced by an understanding of P/OM. The same applies to \ncareers in all other functional areas.\n1.16.1 Career Success and Types of Processes\nIt is essential when talking about careers in P/OM to recognize that one of the \nmajor differences in P/OM jobs relates to the kinds of processes that are involved in \nthe transformation of inputs into outputs. This means such things as the continuity \nof processing, the number of units processed at one time, the volume of throughput \nbetween setups, and the degree of repetition of the operations.\nIt can be seen from the historical development of P/OM that manufacturing \nstarted with custom work, which in many ways resembles an artist at work. For \nexample, the shoemaker who fits and makes the entire shoe for each customer is \nan artist in leather. Most often, the left and right shoes differ. However, for store-\nbought shoes, customized attention to fitting the customer is not possible. The",

For example, when inventories constitute a significant percent \nof the operating budget of a company having thousands of SKUs (stock-keeping \nunits), to be able to analyze huge amounts of data concerning demand levels, lead \ntimes by vendors, costs of materials, business-based carrying and order costs, etc., \nby computer provides a major payoff. Such databases are dynamic. They are chang-\ning all of the time, which requires big data methods to track the changes\u2014and alter \ninventory policies accordingly on a regular basis.\nMaterial requirements planning (MRP) is a manufacturing scheduling appli -\ncation which is extremely data-intensive. It is not included in this text because \nits proper use requires experienced MRP managers whose scheduling abilities are \ndependent on continuously updating their databases concerning the commonality \nof (modular) parts in parent products, modified demand levels, finished goods, and \nwork in process (WIP) as well as materials inventories. Responsibilities for MRP \nare lodged with both P/OM and IT executives. The models for MRP cut across \nOM, IT, and OR analytics. As such, they rightfully belong to MRP\u2014in its own \ndomain.\nSimulation is another systems-oriented approach of great power that gets used \nby OM and OR to solve extensive problems with complex linkages. Proper pro -\ngrams are written by computer experts from IT. Simulations are based on trying \nto connect all of the causal factors that relate to solutions such as how well a new \nairplane can fly in turbulence. Every person who has had a hand in any aspect of \ndesigning, making, or assembling parts is involved with the simulated performance \nof this airplane. This is a good illustration of interdependent responsibilities for \nproblem-solving. The focus transcends departments.\nSuccessful MRP or simulation leads to the question \u201cwhose success are we talking \nabout?\u201d The answer is straightforward from a systems perspective. The organization\u2019s \nsuccess is paramount. Often, in seeking success, each department in an organization \nis faced with opportunities to look good (sometimes) at the expense of others. For \ninstance, the sales department might find that it can sell more product at a lower \nprice than production can deliver. The result is unhappy retail stores and customers. \nTop management receives reports that the sales campaign was successful but produc-\ntion\u2019s inability to deliver product hurt the company\u2019s bottom line. When departments \ncooperate and work together toward a common goal, such damaging tradeoffs are \naverted. Tradeoffs occur all the time that demand nonterritorial solutions.\nChallenging problems cross department lines. Stage IV firms (Chapter 1) have \nshown that coordination of what used to be traditionally separate functions pro -\nvides substantial benefits. Tradeoff situations (where as one department does better, \nanother does worse) are commonplace in business and life. To do what is best for \nthe organization, tradeoffs must be coordinated. P/OM is very conscious of trade-\noff models because they occur in so many aspects of production and operations.",

This means that orders can be \nplaced for nondependent items without considering what demand is forecast for \nthe end products of which they are part. For example, labels for a specific kind of \njam are dependent on the demand for that particular kind of jam. Beach plum jam \nis highly seasonal because of the nature of that crop and does not meet the criteria \nfor stable, continuous demand that characterizes OPP models. Alternatives to OPP \nshould be used when dependent demand systems are involved. This is applicable for \ncomponents and subassemblies that are used as parts of one or more finished prod-\nucts that have sporadic demand. The dependency is greatest when both the timing \nand the quantity for end-product demands are not predictable.\n5.3 Inventory-Related Costs\nThe core of inventory analysis lies in finding and measuring relevant costs. Six \nmain types of costs are discussed and then, in a seventh category, a few others are \nmentioned.\nThe six costs that will be discussed are\n 1. Costs of ordering\n 2. Costs of setups and changeovers\n 3. Costs of carrying inventory\n 4. Costs of discounts\n 5. Out-of-stock costs\n 6. Costs of running the inventory system\n5.3.1 Costs of Ordering\nThe cost of ordering includes those cost items that go into making up and placing \nan order, following up of the order and receiving the order. It consists of writing \nup the purchase requisition form, making phone calls in connection with specifica-\ntions, and ordering, e-mailing, faxing, or mailing purchase orders to the supplier. \nAll costs that increase as a function of the number of purchase requisitions qualify \nfor inclusion.\n5.3.2 Costs of Setups and Changeovers\nIn a manufacturing situation, the ordering cost is replaced by the cost of setting up \nthe machines to do a production run. This requires cleaning up from the prior job, \nwhich also is called taking down. The process is known as changeover, and the costs \ncan be significant.",

Being well informed always represents an advantage \nbecause some alternatives are much better than the others.\nTo illustrate, a variety of organizations purchase all, or part, of the finished goods \nthat they sell without acknowledging their use of outsourcing. The customer believes \nthat the corporate brand name identifies the maker. This ploy may be because the \norganization does not have the capacity to meet demand and, therefore, contracts \nfor the services of co-producers to augment their own output. Over the past decade, \nmany companies have shut down their production facilities in the developed coun-\ntries to gain labor cost advantages in developing countries. Finished goods may be \nshipped directly to customers or put into finished goods inventory in domestic dis-\ntribution centers. From both a production and a transportation standpoint, there \nhave to be tight quality controls with respect to meeting the established standards.\nCo-produced (and co-packed) products have much of their value added by the \nsupplier. The purchaser\u2019s profits are related to marketing, selling, and shipping the \nproduct. There are instances of where firms buy finished goods for sale in certain \ncountries while making them in others. Analysis is based on running the numbers \nfor alternative taxes and tariffs in the countries where finished goods are purchased \nand sold.\n9.3  The Purchasing Function\nPurchasing agents (PAs) and their buying organizations have the traditional role of \nbringing into the organization the needed supplies. Although this is very important, \nthe role is changing, becoming more integrated within the organization and based \non having a wide and informed net of important information. Sourcing (which is \nthe generic name for purchasing every kind of supply needed by the organization) \nhas become a global system.\nThe purchasing department in the twenty-first century is an information-gath -\nering agency. Totally on the up-and-up, by being everywhere and able to listen, it \nis able to learn about new technologies being used by suppliers (as well as the orga-\nnizations they supply) worldwide. It is on top of new materials, new suppliers, new \ndistribution channels, new prices, and new processes that produce quality levels \npreviously not attainable. Up-to-date purchasing departments have a global reach \nvia satellites and telecommunications capabilities that constantly expand horizons.\nThis purchasing department is responsive to the marketing strategies of the \nvarious suppliers from whom it obtains required materials. The old and waning role \nof purchasing is to push suppliers on price. Shopping around for the best prices is \nno longer done by Stage II and IV companies (see Chapter 1). It is far from \u201cbest \npractice.\u201d The price-tag approach has been thrown out in favor of a long-term rela-\ntionship with special trusted suppliers.

This could be caused by a stable \nshift factor such as seasonality. On the other hand, the drivers of change could \nalso be unknown. In the latter case, the instability of causal factors is generally \nacknowledged to reflect high risk. If it is known how demand is changing, then the \nrisk levels may be controllable because forecasts of some merit are possible. OPP \nmethods are applicable to predictable demand distributions. The best of these is \nstable demand but forecasts can be modified if it is known how the distributions \nare changing. Otherwise, the system is searching in the dark. Other methods than \nOPP should be used to manage these situations. Material requirements planning \n(MRP) is the most favored alternative when the demand distribution is unknown \nor unstable. MRP is not discussed in this book.\n5.2.4 Demand Continuity\u2014Smoothly Continuous or Lumpy\nMuch of the prior discussion applies to demand continuity. OPP needs demand \ncontinuity that can be described as persistence of the stable demand pattern over a \nrelatively long time period.\nMRP as an alternative inventory methodology can deal with the lack of \nsmoothly continuous demand. It should be noted that assuming smooth and con -\ntinuous demand is akin to converting a known risk situation into one of certainty. \nThe assumption is usually valid and can be tested by simulating different patterns \nthat are more or less smooth and continuous and measuring the extra costs incurred \nfor assuming perfect smoothness when, in fact, it is good but not perfect. Such \ntesting (called sensitivity analysis) is most readily done with computer simulation \nprograms.\n5.2.5 Lead-Time Distributions\u2014Fixed or Varying\nLT is the interval between order placement and receipt (order need recognition \nand placement times are included). Variability of the LT will be a factor in setting \nthe size of the buffer (safety) stock. As LTs get longer, inventory systems become \nmore sensitive to problems that can arise in the supply chain. One of the main \nreasons is that with long LTs, correction of errors takes longer. The more critical \nthe materials are for production, the worse this situation becomes. For materials \nthat are not critical, the assumption of fixed LTs does not do too much damage. \nWhen materials are critical, inventory planning had best take into account fore -\ncasts for the LT distribution. In that event, LT distributions will assign additional \nunits to buffer stocks. Another name for buffer stock is safety stock (SS) because \nthese units are held to provide protection against variability in demand and (where \napplicable) LTs.",

Below BEP = V*, alternative A returns the greatest profit \nand also, as the volume drops further, A produces the least loss because it has the \nsmallest slope. Other forecasting conditions can occur. The forecast can span the \nvolumes that fall above and below BEP = V*. Then, the procedure is to determine \nthe expected profit by combining the profit and loss function with the probability \ndistribution of demand using a decision matrix. This decision matrix approach is \nnot discussed in this book.\nBEA provides important parameters for evaluating supply chain capacity deci -\nsions. The critical rate of return on capacity is based on the slope of the profit line. \nThe equally critical BEP is determined by the ratio of fixed costs to the per-unit \nmargin contribution which means that total margin contribution at breakeven \ncompletely recovers the fixed costs and no more.\nA.1.3 Interfunctional Breakeven Capacity Planning\nEvery functional manager should be involved in breakeven capacity planning. \nThere is something for every functional manager to be concerned about with the \nbreakeven model. Without true interfunctional planning, all relevant information \ncannot be secured. Successful coordination of process activities is not likely to be \nachieved without the systems approach.\nAccounting: Very careful assignment of fixed charges to each specific product is \nimportant because BEA is done for each product in the supply chain and not for \na product mix. Incorrect assignment of overhead to the fixed costs will affect the \nbreakeven value. It is generally believed that the basic proportions are evident and \nthat roughly the right numbers are used. Activity-based costing may also help move \nsome charges from the fixed to the variable category. This is possible when the cost \nper unit made or serviced can be identified by the accounting system and moved to \nthe variable category.\nThere are some classification problems for variable costs. Differentiating \nbetween direct and indirect labor costs provides an example. Office work is indi -\nrect because such costs usually cannot be attributed to a particular unit of output \non a cost per piece or cost per service-rendered basis. If a direct link can be made so \nthat overhead costs can be assigned directly, then such costs should not be equally \nshared in the overhead pool with other products. It may also allow P/OM to assign \nappropriate variable costs to each product.\nMarketing: Setting product and service prices to create the required demand \nvolume while still generating a fair profit is marketing\u2019s responsibility. The way the \ndemand volume changes as a function of the price set is described by the \u201cprice \nelasticity\u201d of the product or service. Price elasticity is affected by customer qual -\nity expectations and the degree to which competitive products are substitutable. \nAdvertising and promotion strategies are costs usually assigned to overheads. All \nsuch market drivers are crucial to the P/OM domain because they determine out -\nput volumes, thereby affecting supply chain capacity plans.",

Make the interval between samples smaller than usual until the quandary \nis resolved. Sometimes a separate run chart is kept to call attention to points that \nare falling on only one side of the mean value of the chart. Separate charts are not \nrequired if the regular control charts are watched for runs. The charting decision is \ndependent upon the likelihood that runs will play a major role in controlling quality. \nA monotonic run (continuously increasing or decreasing) signals even greater urgency \nto consider the likelihood that an assignable cause has changed the process\u2019s behavior.\nThe important decision to be made in constructing the control charts is to \nestablish the UCL and LCL. We will illustrate this with the help of an example.\n8.6.3.2 Example: Control Charts for a Manufacturing Process\nSuppose a manufacturing process can produce steel rods with an average diameter of \n2.00\u2033 (\u00b5 = 2.00). The standard deviation (\u03c3) representing process variation is 0.01. \nThis information can be used to construct the control chart. It is assumed that the \nprocess output follows a normal distribution. Based on the well-known properties of \nthe normal distribution we can say that 99.72% of the output will lie between \u00b1 3 \nstandard deviations; and 95.44% of the output will lie between \u00b1 2 standard devia-\ntions. The percentages 99.72% and 95.44% are known as confidence intervals. The \nvalues 3 and 2 are standard normal variables and are represented by the symbol z. The \ntable in Appendix B gives the values of z for various confidence intervals. Appendix B \nis included at the end of this textbook. The UCL and LCL are established as follows.\n UCLa nd LCL=+ =\u2212\u00b5\u03c3 \u00b5\u03c3zz .\nFor 99.72% confidence interval (z = 3), the limits are:\n UCL =+ \u2217=20 03 00 12 03.. .,\n LCL =\u2212 \u2217=20 03 00 11 97.. ..\nFor 95.44% confidence interval (z = 2), the limits will be:\n UCL =+ \u2217=20 02 00 12 02.. .,\n LCL =\u2212 \u2217=20 02 00 11 98.. ..\nFigure 8.10 shows the control chart for this example with a confidence interval \nof 99.72%. If two sigma limits are used, the space between the control limits will \nbe narrower and point 5 will fall outside the LCL (1.98).\nThe number of standard deviations used will control the sensitivity of the warn-\ning system.

Then a review occurs and an order is placed. \nDemand variations can continue during the LT. Therefore, exposure to variable \ndemand before correction can be made occurs over a review period and an LT. \nThis requires extra stock for protection, which is a major drawback of the periodic \nmodel. The standard deviation of demand during (t0 + LT) is calculated as follows: \nss() ()t t0 LT LT+ =+ 0 , where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of demand within one \nunit time period (day, week, month, etc.).\nSS is then calculated as SS LT= +z ts()0 , where s()t0 +LT  is the standard deviation \nof demand for the interval (t0 + LT) and z is the standard normal random number \nand is obtained from statistical tables (see Appendix B) based on the desired service \nlevel.\nThe periodic model appeals to managers who like bookkeeping and regularity \nof actions. On the review date, the books are opened. The ledger is added up and \nthe order is placed. The market drives actions in the perpetual, whereas the calendar \ndrives actions in the periodic. The difference is both economic and psychological.\nSummary\nThis chapter addresses \u201cindependent demand\u201d inventory management. It explains \nOPP models in terms of demand continuity. The costs of inventory are treated. \nThese include costs of ordering, setups, and changeovers, carrying inventory, dis -\ncounts, stock-outages, and running the inventory system. Process types differenti -\nate inventory costs.\nThen, EOQ models are developed for batch delivery. The TVC equations are set \nup and solved. EPQ models for continuous delivery of product are contrasted with \nEOQ models. The EPQ are applied to intermittent flow shops. There is discussion \nof LT structure, uncertainty, and variability.\nNext, the perpetual inventory system with its RP and buffer-stock calculations \nis detailed. This includes operation of the two-bin perpetual inventory control sys -\ntem. The periodic inventory system is explained including why this system is being \noutmoded by computer capabilities\u2014yet it still is needed in certain situations.

This is accomplished through constructing statistical \nprocess control (SPC) charts. These charts are used for detecting quality problems, \nmuch as early warning detection systems. SPC charts also can help discern the \ncauses of process quality problems. The SPC charts are extremely powerful for \nmonitoring conditions of the process and for stabilizing processes. SPC is part of \nthe broader QC methodology based on statistical concepts. This is called SQC. \nSQC consists of SPC and AS. We discuss AS later in this chapter. The SPC charts \nare generally called QC charts also. We will use the terms SPC charts and QC \ncharts interchangeably.\nControl charts are constructed by inspecting the process output. The mean of \nthe output and standard deviation of the output are calculated. Inspection can be \ndone by variables or attributes as discussed below.\n8.6.1 Inspection by Variables versus Attributes\nOutput from a process (manufacturing or service) is measured with respect to qual-\nities that are considered to be important. The output can be measured in two dif -\nferent ways: by variables and by attributes. In the case of measurement by variables \nthe numbered measurements are continuous, as with a ruler for measuring inches \nor with a scale for measuring pounds. The variables can have dimensions of weight, \ntemperature, area, strength, electrical resistance, loyalty, satisfaction, defects, typ -\ning errors, complaints, accidents, readership, and TV viewer ratings.

In simpler times, \nwhen goods and services were provided by individual artisans, elaborate \nquality systems were unnecessary. An individual producer could simply \ncompare customer requirements to his or her work and estimate its value.\nThe rise of complex and large enterprises produced the need for the \ndevelopment of objective and equitable quality procedures for the deter -\nmination of value so the owners could assure the efficiency of their opera-\ntions. Traditional quality management concerned itself with \n \ndeveloping \nprocedures to determine product conformance or nonconformance \n(inspection).\nUnfortunately, in too many cases, the study of (inspection) proce -\ndures became an end in itself. Businesses lost sight of the objectives of \nthe \n \nprocedures. \u201cAcceptable\u201d techniques were applied whether they were \nappropriate or not. This in turn led to criticism of quality management \nas a \n \ndiscipline that provided a great deal of largely irrelevant data to \nmanagement.\nFortunately, the discipline is changing. Quality professionals are becom-\ning much more concerned with providing information that will help \nmanagement meet the firm\u2019s goals. In this book, I hope to continue the \nmovement toward consideration of the objectives of quality management \nand value reporting.\nIn quality management, fairness and objectivity play an almost equal \nrole with relevance in the determination of the appropriate quality pro -\ncedures. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specifies \nactivities that must be followed as generally accepted quality principles \nand practices (GAQP) known as ISO 9000. In some cases, the opinions \nof groups with regard to these practices are backed only by the accepted \nstature of the promulgating organizations, whereas in others, the imposed \nrequirements carry the weight of law behind them. In nearly every case, \nthe intent of the suggested (or required) practice is to promote fairness in \nquality and the reporting of quality performance information to a diverse \nmanagement audience.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Today, statistics is widely employed in gov-\nernment, business, and the natural and social sciences.\nBecause of its empirical roots and its applications, statistics is generally \nconsidered not to be a subfield of pure mathematics, but rather a distinct \nbranch of applied mathematics. Its mathematical foundations were laid \nin the seventeenth century with the development of probability theory \nby Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. Probability theory arose from the \nstudy of games of chance. The method of least squares was first described \nby Carl Friedrich Gauss around 1794. The use of modern computers has \nexpedited large-scale statistical computation, and has also made possible \nnew methods that are impractical to perform manually.\nOverview\nIn applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, \none begins with a process or population to be studied. This might be a \n \npopulation of people in a country, of crystal grains in a rock, or of goods \nmanufactured by a particular factory during a given period. It may instead \nbe a process observed at various times; data collected about this kind of \n\u201cpopulation\u201d constitute what is called a time series.\nFor practical reasons, rather than compiling data about an entire pop -\nulation, one usually studies a chosen subset of the population, called a \nsample. Data are collected about the sample in an observational or experi-\nmental setting. The data are then subjected to statistical analysis, which \nserves two related purposes: description and inference.\nDescriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data, either numeri-\ncally or graphically, to describe the sample. Basic examples of numerical \ndescriptors include the mean and standard deviation. Graphical summa -\nrizations include various kinds of charts and graphs.\nInferential statistics is used to model patterns in the data, accounting for \nrandomness and drawing inferences about the larger population. These \ninferences may take the form of answers to yes/no questions (hypothesis \ntesting), estimates of numerical characteristics (estimation), descriptions \nof association (correlation), or modeling of relationships (regression). \nOther modeling techniques include analysis of variance (ANOV A), time \nseries, and data mining.\nThe concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy.

This means that activity B \ncan start at any time between 0 (ES) and 8 (LS) without delaying the project. \nActivities A, D, H, I, and J have zero slack time.

There is a Patent Cooperation Treaty with many \ncases of disagreement in the courts. A new patent law went into effect (Spring \n2013). It is called America Invents Act and it marks a fundamental change. The old \nfirst-to-invent rule has been replaced with the international standard, first-to-file. It \nis too soon to interpret the effect of this change.\n11.3.2 Continuous Innovation (Step 1)\nBefore computer systems became powerful, and widely available, technological \ndiffusion took time. Now, copying can be accomplished in days. What was once \nconsidered to be too complex to imitate is no longer valid. The economic benefits of \npatent protection are under-whelming (at the present time). Continuous innovation \nis the only sure way to stay ahead of the pack.\nThe first step is to cultivate an organizational attitude that fosters creating \nnew ideas to replace old ideas. An organizational culture that embraces disruption \n(Christensen, 2002; Immelt, 2009) must cut across functional domains (Jassawalla, \n2000). A culture that accepts failure as a learning opportunity (Thomke, 2012) is \nprimed for success. It takes a great deal of anxiety or foresight, and flexibility for \ntraditional organizations to make such changes.\nThe reason that anxiety is listed as a possible necessity for changing from a sta -\ntus quo firm to one that innovates continuously is that organizations are constantly \nchallenged with extinction from outside competitors. The potential damages are \nnot trivial. Management must take actions from inside the organization to counter \nthe attacks from outside. Otherwise, deterioration of market conditions is inevi -\ntable. Competitive efforts to seduce loyal customers are inescapable.\nConsider on-going battles between smart phone manufacturers. Apple, \nBlackberry, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, and Samsung (in alphabetical order) are \nvying with each other to grab market share by outdating their opponents\u2019 prod -\nucts. Challenges are frequently based on competitive intelligence (knowledge \nabout weaknesses in competitors\u2019 products, often gained from focus group market \nresearch; sometimes gained by pressure, bribes, and spying).

During the \nperiod from December 2007 to June 2009, there was a subprime mortgage crisis \nthat led to the collapse of the housing bubble in the USA. This triggered a global \nfinancial crisis.

This is done in general \nin an accelerated experiment with increased stress. These experiments can \nbe divided into two main categories.\nEarly failure rate studies determine the distribution with a decreasing \nfailure rate over the first part of the bathtub curve. Here, in general, only \nmoderate stress is necessary. The stress is applied for a limited period \nof\n \ntime in what is called a censored test . Therefore, only the part of the \ndistribution with early failures can be determined.\nIn so-called zero-defect experiments, only limited information about the \nfailure distribution is acquired. Here the stress, stress time, or the sample \nsize is so low that not a single failure occurs. Due to the insufficient sample \nsize, only an upper limit of the early failure rate can be determined. At any \nrate, it looks good for the customer if there are no failures.\nIn a study of the intrinsic failure distribution, which is often a material \nproperty, higher stresses are necessary to achieve failure in a reasonable \nperiod of time. Several degrees of stress have to be applied to determine an \nacceleration model. The empirical failure distribution is often parameter -\nized with a Weibull or a log-normal model.\nIt is a general praxis to model the early failure rate with an exponen -\ntial distribution. This less complex model for the failure distribution has \nonly one parameter: the constant failure rate. In such cases, the chi-square \ndistribution can be used to find the goodness of fit for the estimated fail -\nure rate. Compared to a model with a decreasing failure rate, this is quite \n \npessimistic. Combined with a zero-defect experiment, this becomes even \nmore pessimistic. The effort is greatly reduced in this case: one does not \nhave to determine a second model parameter (e.g., the shape parameter \nof a Weibull distribution) or its confidence interval (e.g., by a maximum \nlikelihood approach, or MLE), and the sample size is much smaller.\nr\neliability \nt\nest \nr\nequirements\nBecause reliability is a probability, even highly reliable systems have some \nchance of failure.

It is an important way of grading how well P/OM and the rest of the system \nare doing. It is a score like RBIs (runs batted in), your credit rating, or ROI (return \non investment).\nProductivity, according to The Association for Operations Management, \nwhich used to be called the American Production and Inventory Control Society \n(APICS), is defined as \u201can overall measure of the ability to produce a good or \na service.\u201d It is the actual output of production compared to the actual input of \nresources.

When outputs are high and \ninputs are low, the system is said to be efficient and productive.

Several authors have proposed ways to measure \nservice productivity. Some of these are described below.\nLevitt (1972), in his article, Production Line Approach to Service , argues that, \n\u201cif customer service is consciously treated as \u2018manufacturing in the field,\u2019 it will \nget the same kind of detailed attention that manufacturing gets. It will be carefully \nplanned, controlled, automated where possible, audited for quality control, and reg-\nularly reviewed for performance improvement and customer reaction.\u201d In the arti -\ncle, Managing Our Way to Higher Service-Sector Productivity, Biema and Greenwald \n(1997) also argue that productivity improvement techniques used in manufacturing \nsector are applicable to service sector as well in spite of the complexity of the service \nsector.\nAccording to Drucker (1999), improving knowledge\u2013worker productivity is one \nof the biggest challenges in the twenty-first century. He lists six major determinants \nof knowledge\u2013worker productivity.

We have made references to these two techniques in various \nchapters of this book.\nA.1 Breakeven Models\nBreakeven models are one of the most significant methods for making manage -\nment decisions in all functional areas of management. In P/OM, breakeven mod -\nels can be used to make the following decisions among others: location, capacity, \ninvestment in plant and equipment, investment in information technology, and \noutsourcing (make or buy).\nThese models are applicable when we deal with a situation in which there is a \nfixed cost which is independent of the output volume, a variable cost that changes \nper unit of output and a revenue amount per unit sold. A discussion of these costs \nis in order before we discuss the breakeven models.\nVariable (Direct) Costs\nVariable costs per unit are the costs of input resources that tend to be fully charge -\nable and directly attributable to the product. They are also called direct costs \nbecause they are paid out on a per-unit of output basis. Direct costs for labor and \nmaterials are typical. Variable costs can often be decreased by improving the way \nthat jobs are done. Material costs can sometimes be reduced using value analysis to \nimprove material usage or find better materials at lower costs. Changing order sizes \ncan increase discounts, and grouping purchases can result in lower transportation \ncosts for full carloads. Lower cost suppliers directly decrease the variable cost of \ninventory being held and stored. P/OM has many avenues to pursue as it strives to \ncontinuously improve quality while reducing variable costs.",

There \nare a great many avenues for scientific and technical intelligence to be procured by \npotential competitors. Speculation about the details of innovations by such compa-\nnies as Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, and Samsung abound. Such \u201cintel\u201d \n(which has been known to involve actual spying) comes from many sources includ-\ning in-house workers but more often from those who work for vendors that are \nthought to be supplying materials, parts, and components for the final product.\nTesting (for example, with focus groups) puts potential versions of the prod -\nuct in the hands of consumers who are not obliged to keep secrets. An industry of \njournalists tracking developments has appeared which feeds on stock market frenzy \nof traders who want to know about innovations that can disrupt existing markets. \nThere are also a plethora of patent contests which leads to such news items as \u201cJury \nawards Apple $1.049 billion in Samsung patent dispute ruling.\u201d That was August of \n2012.

If this is not done properly, the innovation can fail to \nachieve market success. Problems caused by supply not being in sync with demand \noccur when customers, expecting a new model, stop buying the prior model (e.g., \na new version of Office software, next year\u2019s auto model, or a new iPhone release). \nIdeally, prior version inventories are reduced to match the expected demand at a lower \nprice level.

One of \nthese cause and effect charts is the fishbone (or Ishikawa) chart which is based on \nlisting variables that are known to affect quality. These charts are organized with \nthe quality goal shown at the right. Scatter diagrams, studied in the chapter on \nforecasting, also help in determining causality. To determine the cause of a quality \nproblem, start by listing everything in the process that might be responsible for the \nproblem. A reasonable approach is to determine the factors that cause good (or bad) \nquality. These potential causes are grouped into categories and subcategories, as is \ndone for the following example, which lists many of the factors responsible for the \nquality of a cup of coffee. The processes used to grow coffee beans, harvest, roast, \nstore, and ship the coffee would be included in this cause-and-effect diagram if \nthere was control over these factors. Here, the coffee-making process begins with \nthe goal of making a good cup of coffee. All participating processes are part of the \ncausal system.\n8.5.5.1 Example: A Good Cup of Coffee\nThe quality of a cup of coffee is a big business with growth opportunities, chal -\nlenges, and concerns. Chains of coffee shops have opened thousands of stores all \nover the United States, Europe, and Asia. Starbuck\u2019s (http://www.starbucks.com) \nand Dunkin\u2019 Donuts (http://www.dunkindonuts.com) have enormous numbers of \nstores all over the world. With billions of dollars at stake, companies find it worth -\nwhile to scrutinize various business models each with its own concept of how con -\nsumers perceive quality. Table 8.1 captures many of the multidimensional factors \nthat determine the quality of a cup of coffee. Specifically, Table 8.1 presents a list of \ncausal factors that should be considered by all participants in the system that affects \nthe quality of a cup of coffee. After making the list, these variables can be charted \nusing the fishbone construction method developed by Ishikawa (1987).\nThere are nine main variables and different numbers of subcategory variables. \nThe latter are shown in Figure 8.9 as fins radiating from the nine lines of the main \nvariables, connected to what looks like the spine of a fish. The subcategories are \nlisted in Table 8.1 under the nine main variables.\nThe fishbone diagram is conducive to systems-wide discussion, involving every-\none, concerning the completeness of the diagram. Have all the important factors \nbeen listed? When the fishbone diagram is considered complete, there follows the \ndetermination of what variations should be tested. Market research is used to test \nconsumer reactions to the new product and process alternatives.\nReturning to the power failure situation, the household consumer of electricity \nis unlikely to know which cause is responsible for any failure. The electric utility, \non the other hand, can do the necessary detective work to determine what has \ncaused each failure.

Loading is needed for machine shops, hospitals, and offices. \nSpecifically, loading assigns the work to various facilities like divisions, depart -\nments, work centers, load centers, stations, machines, and people. We will often \nuse the term \u201cmachines\u201d in this chapter when we refer to a facility. Loading releases \njobs to facilities. Although loading assigns work to facilities, it does not specify the \norder in which jobs should be done at the facility. Sequencing methods (described \nlater) determine the order of work at the facility.\nAggregate planning (or aggregate scheduling) used standard hours based on \nforecasts to determine what resources should be assembled over the planning hori -\nzon. However, loading takes place in the production department when the real \norders are on hand. The loading function loads the real jobs and not the fore -\ncast. If the aggregate scheduling job was done well, then the appropriate kinds and \namounts of resources are available for loading. Loading assumes that the material \nrequirement analysis has been done and that orders have been properly placed for \nrequired materials and for needed parts and subassemblies. It further assumes that \nthe parts will be on hand, as planned. A problem in supplier shipments can delay \nscheduling production of the affected order. The MPS also made resource assign -\nments that could be modified if capacity was not adequate. Planning actual shop \nassignments is a regular, repetitive managerial responsibility. Releasing the jobs, as \nper assignment, is another.\nEach facility carries a backlog of work, which is its \u201cload\u201d\u2014hardly a case of per-\nfect just-in-time in which no waiting occurs. The backlog is generally much larger \nthan the work in process, which can be seen on the shop floor. This is because work \nnot assigned yet is waiting. It may appear to be clutter or it can be hidden in storage \nspaces. Even when it is visible, it is hard to know the backlog which translates into \nan inventory investment which is idle and receiving no value-adding attention. A \nmajor objective of loading is to spread the load so that waiting is minimized, flow \nis smooth and rapid, and congestion is avoided.\nThese objectives are constrained by the fact that not all workstations can do all \nkinds of jobs. Some workstations and people are better suited for specific jobs than \nare others. Some stations cannot do jobs that others can do. Some are faster than \nothers and tend to be overloaded. The scheduling objective is to smooth the load \nwith balanced work assignments at stations.\nMethods for loading include assignment method, the transportation method, \nand various heuristics. However, these methods are not discussed in this book.",

When P/OM and marketing \nmanagers look for break-through innovations, the likely sources will be from those \nwho work in process and product design and in the R&D labs who can translate \nwhat complaints plague customers into technological developments that might \nalleviate their problems.\nThis discussion brings to mind the Gravity Research Foundation established in \n1948 by Roger Babson (founder of Babson College). Babson sponsored the devel -\nopment of new products that would function when shielded from the effects of \ngravity. In other words, he supported the development of products that worked on \nprinciples that do not exist. No technology has been found that can remove the \neffects of gravity. The Foundation disappeared after Babson\u2019s death in 1967 but the \nstory remains as an illustration of the fact that new technology can give rise to new \nproducts; whereas, hopes, wants, and wishes do not. In the same vein, customers \nwanted bigger and stronger fans until the new technology of air-conditioning was \nfully developed. Florida will soon become the third most populous state in the \nUSA because air-conditioning is cheap. Before air-conditioning, Florida was thinly \npopulated and would have remained so.

From prior discussions about innovation it is evi -\ndent that many competitors, and potential competitors, are likely to be working on \nnew products that are quite similar to each other. Some are focused on incremental \nimprovements of existing products in the market (known as the kaizen-orientation). \nOthers are radical innovations that will disrupt the market if they succeed in gaining \na foothold\u2014leading to an eventual tipping point. See The Innovators Dilemma: When \nNew Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail , and The Innovator\u2019s Solution: Creating \nand Sustaining Successful Growth,  Christensen, 1997, 2003). See also, The Tipping \nPoint: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (Gladwell, 2000).\nIt is hardly surprising that many potential competitors are working on the same \ntechnological problems.

Many factors that allowed one firm to \u201cget there first\u201d constituted \nsignificant \u201cbarriers to entry\u201d for subsequent competitors. This is no longer the \ncase. The second to enter is an imitator. The economics of the imitator have some \nadvantages if imitation is used to correct shortcomings of the first to produce a \nbetter product. The struggle between the first and the best can favor the best. The \nimitator may be able to price the new product significantly below the originator \n(first).

OC curves can be drawn \nfor double and multiple sampling plans also.\n8.12 International Quality Standards\nEach country has its own quality standards. For example, The American National \nStandards Institute (ANSI) and the American Society for QC (ASQC) have jointly \npublished a series of quality specifications\u2014called the Q90 series. However, it is \nimportant to establish global quality standards because of increasing world trade \nand global supply chains. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \nwas set up to meet the need for international quality standards. ISO officially began \noperation on February 23, 1947. ISO is constantly engaged in setting standards for \nproducts, processes, information systems, and the environment with respect to every \ntype of organization and activity. The organization, ISO has developed a comprehen-\nsive system for certifying that companies in any part of the world have voluntarily \nmet the standards and qualify as ISO certified. The most well-known ISO standards \nare the ISO 9000 (quality series) and the ISO 14000 (environmental series).\nISO\u2019s work program ranges from standards for traditional activities, such as agri-\nculture and construction, through mechanical engineering, to medical devices, to the \nnewest information technology developments. Standardization of screw threads helps \nkeep chairs, children\u2019s bicycles, and aircraft together with minimum wasted time. Try \nto solve the repair and maintenance problems that would be caused by a lack of stan-\ndardization. Standards establish common parts and international consensus on termi-\nnology, which makes technology transfer easier. Without the standardized dimensions \nof freight containers, international trade would be slower and more expensive. Without \nthe standardization of telephone and banking cards, life would be more complicated \nand more expensive. A lack of standardization may even affect the quality of life itself: \nfor the disabled, for example, when they are barred access to consumer products\u2014\npublic transportation and buildings\u2014because the dimensions of wheelchairs and \nentrances are not standardized. Standardized traffic symbols provide danger warnings \nno matter what the spoken language is. Consensus on grades of various materials gives \na common reference for suppliers and clients in business dealings. Agreement on a \nsufficient number of variations of a product to meet most current applications allows \neconomies of scale with cost benefits for both producers and consumers.\nAn example of failure is the lack of standardization of paper sizes. ISO 216 \ndefines A and B paper series. ISO 269 defines a C paper series, and there is more. \nThis is not a happy situation for printers and faxes being interchangeable around \nthe globe.

These include possible legal damage claims, bad publicity, and the loss of \ncustomers. Curves that chart the cost of failure are likely to have steeply ascending, \nexponential, or geometric shapes.\n8.4.4 The Total Cost of Quality\nThe three kinds of costs in Figure 8.4 permit derivation of a total cost curve. This \ncurve is U-shaped. Total costs are minimized at some level of percent defectives. \nHowever, there can be disagreement with this proposition. Situations exist in \nwhich, for small increases in prevention costs, percent defectives will be dramati -\ncally reduced. Also, there are conditions when the cost of failure does not rise expo-\nnentially because the impact of failure is trivial (the pencil point broke) or because \ninspection catches 100% of the defectives. With effective inspection, the percent \ndefectives produced are substantially higher than the percent defectives shipped \nand there is a cost of scrapping the product.\nOn the other hand, if the cost of failure rises very fast, then the indicated mini-\nmum cost point is pushed towards the zero level of percent defectives. The total \ncost of quality increases geometrically as the percentage defectives rises. Six-Sigma \nmethodology assumes that this situation of serious consequences for failure often \nexists, for example, when the airplane control system does not recognize that the \ncourse setting is heading into a mountain (google American Airlines flight 965). \nThe curves for the costs of quality are logical in certain circumstances; they are \nconjectural and plain wrong in others. However, modeling quality costs remains an \nimportant effort and worthwhile endeavor for P/OM. The extra effort to ascertain \nthe correctness of the cost model is justified when prevention is viable and/or failure \ninvolves an extreme penalty.\n8.5 QC Methodology\nThe body of knowledge that relates to quality attainment starts with the detection \nof problems. This is followed by diagnosis based on the analysis of the causes of the \nproblems. Next comes the prescription of corrective actions to treat the diagnosed \ncauses. This is followed up through observations and evaluations to see how well \nthe treatment works. The entire set of steps is called QC.\nQuality originates with a thorough understanding of the process. P/OM is \ninvolved in getting everyone in the company motivated to know all about the pro -\ncesses being used and changes under consideration. Process QC methods are used \nto analyze and improve process quality. There are seven time-honored and well-\nestablished methods. These are (1) data check sheets, (2) bar charts, (3) histograms, \n(4) Pareto analysis, (5) cause-and-effect charts, (6) statistical QC (SQC) charts, \nand (7) run charts.

Nevertheless, fault density serves as a useful indicator for the reli -\nability engineer. Other software metrics, such as complexity, are also \nused.\nTesting is even more important for software than hardware. Even the \nbest software development process results in some software faults that \nare nearly undetectable until tested. As with hardware, software is tested \nat several levels, starting with individual units, through integration and \nfull-up system testing. Unlike with hardware, it is inadvisable to skip lev -\nels of software testing. During all phases of testing, software faults are dis-\ncovered, corrected, and retested. Reliability estimates are updated based \non the fault density and other metrics. At the system level, MTBF data are \ncollected and used to estimate reliability. Unlike with hardware, perform-\ning the exact same test on the exact same software configuration does not \nprovide increased statistical confidence. Instead, software reliability uses \ndifferent metrics such as test coverage.\nEventually, the software is integrated with the hardware in the top-level \nsystem, and software reliability is subsumed by system reliability. The \nSoftware Engineering Institute\u2019s capability maturity model is a common \nmeans of assessing the overall software development process for reliability \nand quality purposes.\nr\neliability Operational \na\nssessment\nAfter a system is produced, reliability engineering during the system oper-\nation phase monitors, assesses, and corrects deficiencies. Data collection \nand analysis are the primary tools used. When possible, system failures \nand corrective actions are reported to the reliability engineering organi -\nzation. The data are constantly analyzed using statistical techniques, such \nas Weibull analysis and linear regression, to ensure the system reliability \nmeets the specification. Reliability data and estimates are also key inputs \nfor system logistics. Data collection is highly dependent on the nature \nof the system. Most large organizations have quality control groups that \ncollect failure data on vehicles, equipment, and machinery. Consumer \nproduct failures are often tracked by the number of returns. For systems \nin dormant storage or on standby, it is necessary to establish a formal \nsurveillance program to inspect and test random samples.

Those who want to reach further can do so, but that is by choice. The \nmain concepts and their applications are readily available without requisite training \nin mathematical manipulations. This textbook is particularly suitable for online \ncourses where students require detailed explanations of the problems. The step by \nstep solutions for all problems included in this book are available on the instruc -\ntors\u2019 resource CD (IRCD). The students can review the material at their own pace.\nThe topics are modular, which means that instructors who like to start with \nsupply chain management (Chapter 9) and then move on to inventory management \n(Chapter 5) and then quality management (Chapter 8) can do so in that order. \nMajor changes have occurred in how quickly product line stability is disrupted. \nCompetition reacts quickly and response must be rapid. Therefore, some instruc -\ntors might prefer to begin with project management (Chapter 7) to reflect the con-\ntinuous project mode required for fast redesign rapid response. Alternatively, some \nteachers may prefer to start with Chapter 11 on Innovation by P/OM for New \nProduct Development (NPD) and Sustainability.

Each event \n(observation of demand) is time-tagged so that it is known where it is located in \nthe series of data. The time series consists of data recorded at different time periods \nsuch as weekly or daily for the variable, which could be units produced or demands \nreceived.

Extrapolation is the process of moving \nfrom observed data (past and present) to the unknown values of future points. The \nextrapolation of time series is one of the main functions of forecasting.\nThe data in time series may consist of several different kinds of variations. \nImportant among them are random variations, an increasing or decreasing trend, \nand seasonal variations.

Having a truck run to fulfill requirements of the perpetual \ninventory system could be far too costly. Second, some advanced inventory models \nmix the use of the perpetual and the periodic systems with the result that costs are \nfurther reduced. Therefore, it is useful to understand the mechanism of the periodic \nmodel.\nInventory models (such as the two mentioned here) are based on the concepts \nand mathematical structure of an EOQ\u2014the fixed amount to order, or an EPQ\u2014\nthe fixed amount to produce. EOQ and EPQ have been discussed earlier.\nThere is another set of problems that are not resolved by OPP inventory models. \nThose \u201cother\u201d situations are dealt with by MRP\u2014not discussed in this book. At \nthis moment, the point to make is that MRP is used when the assumptions about \norder continuity and consistency of demand that are required by EOQ and EPQ \nare not met.\nThe most important requirements for EOQ and EPQ (which are OPP models) \nare consistency of independent demand over time with relatively smooth and regu-\nlar withdrawal patterns of units from stock. MRP works for sporadic dependent \ndemand by using information systems control of messy demand patterns. MRP \nrequires detailed information-processing capabilities, which have grown enor -\nmously since MRP was first developed in the 1960\u2019s. When OPP is an online sys -\ntem, dealing with the perpetual inventory management of large numbers of SKUs, \nsignificant information capabilities are also required.\n5.10 Perpetual (Fixed Quantity) Inventory Systems\nPerpetual, also known as fixed quantity, inventory systems continuously record \ninventory received from suppliers and withdrawn by employees. Most perpetual \ninventory systems are used online, in real time with some demand variability. The \nEOQ and EPQ models discussed so far do not include demand variability. In many \npractical situations, this assumption is unrealistic. With modifications, the EOQ \nand EPQ models can deal with demand variability.\nVariability of demand arises from variations in order sizes. Variability is passed \nalong the supply chain, affecting everyone. Customers are the primary cause of \ndemand variability. There are other causes of demand variability as well. These \ninclude stock on-hand replacement to make up for items lost as a result of ware -\nhouse fires, employee pilferage, and the discovery that items in stock cannot be \nshipped because they are defective.\nConsider what occurs when a machine setting changes, creating a large number \nof rejects that cannot be reworked. Production must run larger numbers of items \nto compensate for the scrap. More materials must be withdrawn from inventory to \nbe used by the process. The supplier furnished the usual number of units per order \nthat was based on the estimate of the expected demand ( D). Because demand is \nlarger than expected, the RP, QRP, will be reached sooner.

The design of \njobs determines the amount of labor and the skill levels required. The responsibility \nfor low, unit variable costs leads P/OM to want high volumes so that it can take \nadvantage of the resulting economies of scale.\nFor many reasons, including the material discounts previously discussed and \na general learning effect, variable costs per unit decrease as volume increases. This \nresult, called the economies of scale, is quite similar to the \u201cExperience Curve\u201d of the \nBoston Consulting Group (BCG) (1968), which yields a 20\u201330% decrease in per unit \ncosts with each doubling of the volume.

The stages of history have moved production and operations \ncapabilities from low-volume custom work through high-volume rapid and con -\ntinuous output systems, modular production, and mass customization.\nAttention shifts from custom crafts, which are art-based, to the theory of pro -\nduction, which has evolved over time. This theory consists of six established steps \nand a potential seventh one. There is emphasis on manufacturing because the the -\nory evolved from the production of goods, but the theory has now transcended \nmanufacturing and is applicable to service operations.

It is \nnot possible to pinpoint exactly when each contribution was made.\nThe capability of P/OM processes to deliver goods and services has changed in \nsteps or stages over time. The study of the history of P/OM production transforma-\ntion processes allows us to determine which events triggered these stages of produc-\ntion theory.

Sequencing involves shop floor control, which consists of communicating \nthe status of orders and the productivity of workstations. Sequencing establishes the \norder for doing the jobs at each facility. Sequencing reflects job priorities according \nto the way that jobs are arranged in the queues. Say that Jobs x, y, and z have been \nassigned to workstation 1 (loading). Jobs x, y, and z are in a queue (waiting line). \nSequencing rules determine which job should be first in line, which second, etc. \nThere are different costs associated with the various orderings of jobs. The objective \nfunction can be to minimize system\u2019s costs, or to minimize total system\u2019s time, or \n(if margin data are available) to maximize total system\u2019s profit. We discuss several \nobjective functions later in the chapter.\nGood sequencing provides less waiting time, decreased delivery delays, and bet-\nter due date performance. There are costs associated with waiting and delays. Total \nsavings from regularly sequencing the right way the first time can accumulate to \nsubstantial sums. Re-sequencing can be significantly more costly. When there are \nmany jobs and facilities, sequencing rules have considerable economic importance.\n6.1.3 Scheduling Example\nAs discussed above, scheduling determines the order in which the jobs assigned to \na machine or a group of machines will be processed. Each job is characterized by \nits routing that specifies the information about the operations to be performed, the \nsequence of these operations, the machines required for processing these opera -\ntions, and the times required for processing these operations. Consider the example \ngiven in Table 6.1 after the loading decisions have been made.\nThere are three jobs A, B, and C that have to be produced. The loading function \nhas assigned these jobs to be processed on four machines that are designated as M1, \nM2, M3, and M4. Each machine performs a specific function and the machines are \nnot interchangeable. The three jobs consist of 4, 3, and 4 operations, respectively. \nThe operations of job A are designated as A1, A2, A3, and A4. The operations of job \nB are designated as B1, B2, and B3. Similarly, the four operations of job C are des-\nignated as C1, C2, C3, and C4. Each operation is processed on a specific machine. \nTable 6.1 gives the machines required for each operation of each job and its process-\ning time. For example, it shows that the first operation of job A, A1, is processed on \nmachine M1 and requires 5 days; second operation, A2, is processed on machine \nM3 and requires 3 days, and so on. A machine may be required more than once for \na job. For example, operation A4 might have needed M3 again instead of M2. In \nthat case, the sequence of machines required for job A will be M1\u2013M3\u2013M4\u2013M3.\nThe operations of all jobs have to follow their processing sequences.

In this regard, balancing errors of commission and omission requires strate-\ngic thinking that unites all of the components and constituencies of the system. It is \ndangerous to set goals based on thinking about only one type of error.\nThe inspection process may involve a 100% inspection or the decision may be \nbased on inspecting a sample of items taken from the lot. Acceptance Sampling (AS) \nis the process of using samples at both the input and the output stages in a manufac-\nturing process. AS uses statistical sampling theory to determine if the supplier\u2019s out-\nputs shipped to the producer meet standards. Then, in turn, AS is used to determine \nif the producer\u2019s outputs meet the producer\u2019s standards for the customers. Usually, the \npurchased materials are shipped in lot sizes, at intervals over time. The buyer has set \nstandards for the materials and inspects a sample to make certain that the shipment \nconforms. When the sample has too many defectives, the lot will be rejected and \nreturned to the manufacturer\u2014or it can be detailed. Detailing means using 100% \ninspection of rejected lots to remove defectives. Sometimes the supplier delivers the \nsample for approval before sending the complete shipment. Sampling plans are often \npart of the buyer\u2013supplier contract. AS is particularly well suited to exported items. \nBefore the products are shipped to the buyer, they are inspected at the exporting \nplant. Only if they pass are they shipped. The same reasoning makes sense for ship-\nments that move large distances, even within the same country. In the case of sam -\npling, the sample is assumed to represent the quality of the shipment submitted for \ninspection. It is also assumed that the process that made the product is under control \nin the SQC sense. Each method has its pros and cons as discussed below.\nThere are times when 100% inspection is the best procedure. When human \nchecking is involved, it may be neither cost-efficient nor operationally effective. \nAutomated inspection capabilities are changing this scenario. The use of 100% \ninspection makes sense for parachutists and for products where failure is life-threat-\nening. Inspections that are related to life-and-death dependencies deserve at least \n100% and, perhaps, even 1000% inspection. For parachute inspections and surgical \ncases, a second opinion is a good idea. It is human nature that it is easier to spot \ndefects in the works of others than in one\u2019s own work. NASA continuously monitors \nmany quality factors at space launchings. Aircraft take-off rules are a series of checks \nthat constitute 100% inspection of certain features of the plane. There have been \noccasions when pilots forgot to do a checking procedure with dire consequences.\nAn economic reason to shun 100% inspection is that it is often labor-intensive. \nThis means it is likely to be more expensive than sampling the output. A common \ncriticism of 100% inspection is that it is not fail-safe because it is human to err. \nInspectors\u2019 boredom makes them very human in this regard. Sampling puts less \nof a burden on inspectors. Inspection procedures performed by people are less reli -\nable and have lower accuracy when the volume of throughput is high.

That is, the item that has the highest annual dollar volume is on \nthe top. The next step is to calculate the percentage of annual dollar volume.

Imitators are watching and waiting \nfor innovators to trip up. They are usually ready to take advantage of mistakes \nthat \u201coriginators\u201d often make. Although innovators know about potential pitfalls, \ndriven by the need for speed they fail to protect themselves. Among the origina -\ntors\u2019 mistakes are: bad timing, over-claiming, under-performing, and failure to \nup-grade fast enough when competitors\u2019 products enter the market (Billington \net al., 1988).\nBad timing occurs when the new product is offered to consumers before they \nfully understand why they want the new product. Early growth of demand is too \nslow. Conversely, there is bad timing when demand overpowers supply and cus -\ntomers are irritated by unexpected delivery delays. Shipping product that must be \nrecalled because adequate quality controls were not exercised is a serious downer. \nNumerous examples of consumers being upset by having to wait for delivery or \nby having to return recalled product can be cited. The production supply system \nmust be synchronized to an intelligent marketing demand creation system. If \nthese two functional systems are not coordinated, various kinds of serious fail -\nures are likely.\nOver-claiming product attributes is difficult to avoid when advertising. The \nconsumer gets quite used to this. Imitative competitors take advantage of over-\nclaiming by incorporating advances based on \u201cbeing second\u201d and thereby discover-\ning how to leapfrog the original product. The \u201cleapfrogging effect\u201d is where those \nwho are lagging the innovators gain an advantage over first movers by imitating \nthe originators with improvements that are based on consumer reactions to the \noriginal design. The originator\u2019s initial investment (legacy situation) prevents rapid \nresponses to the leapfrogging imitator.\nIn other words, imitators can get ahead of the original innovator by provid -\ning in their imitation more of what was promised but was not sufficient in the \n\u201coriginal\u201d product. Innovators\u2019 investment risks can be reduced (but not entirely) if \ncareful analysis is employed. Over-claiming and under-performing by the innova -\ntor are mistakes that are closely related.

Statistics offers methods to estimate and cor-\nrect for randomness in the sample and in the data collection procedure, \nas well as methods for designing robust experiments in the first place. \nThe fundamental mathematical concept employed in understanding such \nrandomness is probability.

This means that each and every item \nis not at maximum quality and productivity. The nature of the goal is to select assign-\nments that\u2014although less than best individually\u2014result in the overall system\u2019s best.\nProduction scheduling is always a system\u2019s problem because jobs, people, and \nteams compete with each other for best facilities. Jobs (as surrogates for customers) \nalso compete with each other concerning which gets done first. Facilities compete \nwith each other for jobs. Departments that do similar work compete with each \nother for preferred work. Orders placed with suppliers are tied to priorities with \nrespect to jobs and customers, so suppliers\u2019 orders also rival each other in terms of \nimportance and how they are treated.\nStrategic planning is required to design the facilities, staff the departments, \nselect suppliers, and design the product mix\u2014for the expected blend of job shop \norders. In contrast, the flow shop has a specific set of items to be made in volume \non dedicated facilities. The flow shop system is predesigned to optimize the produc-\ntion schedule through synchronization. The difference between a job shop and flow \nshop is explained later in this chapter.\nWith the job shop, the company must achieve systems optimization to rational-\nize the various preferences in a way that is not self-defeating. When the systems \npoint of view prevails, the solutions are company-wide optimizations even though \npeople and facilities experience suboptimal assignments. Over time, the facilities \nneed to be altered in such a way as to minimize the degree of suboptimization. That \nrequires strategic thinking.\nThe final step of production scheduling assigns actual jobs to designated facili -\nties with unambiguous stipulations that they be completed at specific times. The \nsteps in scheduling are reviewed below, moving from generic resource planning to \nactual assignments at workstations.\n 1. Aggregate planning (scheduling) developed resource plans based on forecasts of \norders in generic units such as standard hours. This was studied in Chapter 4.\n 2. Later, with actual orders on hand or with reasonable predictions about orders, \nthe master production schedule (MPS) assigns jobs to time slots to permit \norders to be placed for required materials using material requirements plan -\nning (MRP). These time period assignments are so well defined that they are \nreferred to as time buckets. MRP is not the subject matter of this book.\n 3. The next step in production scheduling is to load facilities, which means tak -\ning the actual orders and assigning them to designated facilities. The loading \nfunction answers the question: Which department is going to do what work? \nSequencing answers the question: What is the order in which the work will \nbe done?",

Production is an old and venerable term used by engineers, economists, \nentrepreneurs, and managers to describe physical work both in homes and in facto-\nries to produce a material product.\nOperations management is a more recent term associated with services per -\nformed by organizations such as banks, insurance companies, fast-food servers, \nand airlines. Government jobs are also in the services. Healthcare providers, \nincluding hospitals and schools, belong to the services category. Running the \nOlympic Games is an operations management job. It is not surprising that there \nhas been a rapid growth of service jobs in the US economy. The current ratio of \nservice jobs to manufacturing jobs is nearly 4:1, compared to an approximate 1:1 \nratio in the 1950\u2019s. As a result, the number of people that are now engaged in \noperations is far larger (and still growing) than the number of people that work \nin manufacturing.\nManufacturers have come to view service to the customer as part of the quality \nof the product line. This includes repairing defective products as well as providing \nregularly scheduled maintenance. Auto manufacturers learned a great deal from \nAcura when Honda launched that division with a service mission that eclipsed any-\nthing in auto service that preceded it. One of the best automotive service operations \nbefore Acura was Honda itself, so there was precedent to follow. Xerox, after los -\ning significant market share, began to establish strict guidelines for the maximum \nallowable downtimes that would be tolerated for its copying machines. Until the \n1990\u2019s, IBM provided almost no service to its personal computer customers. After a \nserious fall from grace, IBM changed its policy and became a full-service company \nto all of its customers.\nHaving developed a successful consulting business model, which accounted for \nmost of its profits, IBM sold its personal computer product line to Lenovo, China\u2019s \nleading PC-maker, for $1.75 billion dollars in December 2004. Lenovo completed \nthe purchase of IBM\u2019s PC division in May 2005, after receiving clearance from \nthe US Committee on Foreign Investment in March 2005. Lenovo became \u201cthe \nworld\u2019s third-largest PC maker,\u201d according to The New York Times, Business Day, \np. C5, May 2, 2005. After a rocky transition, earnings swung back to black in the \nfourth quarter of fiscal 2007.\nLenovo inherited from IBM the right to sponsor the 2008 Beijing Olympics. \nThis included designing the 2008 Olympic Torch and supplying the digital foun -\ndation of the Olympics administration. A year-long test period was designed by \nLenovo to check on all aspects of operations. Using 14,000 pieces of computing \nequipment, Lenovo gathered and stored participants\u2019 data, display scores, and orga-\nnized all activities of the BOCOG (Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games",

The \ncost of learning is involved and defectives play a role. When acquiring equipment, \nchangeover times and costs can be as important to consider as output rates.\n5.3.3 Costs of Carrying Inventory\nInventory is a form of investment. Capital is tied up in materials and goods. The \nalternative uses of inventory include spending for R&D, new product and/or pro -\ncess development, advertising, promotion, and going global. Some firms even put \nthe money into financial instruments, the stock market, or the savings bank.\nExpanded capacity and diversification are typical opportunities that, when \nignored, incur the cost of not doing that much better with the investment funds. \nBy holding inventory, the company foregoes investing its capital in these alternative \nways. Such opportunity costs account for a large part of the costs of carrying inventory.\nThese are the costs over which P/OM can exercise control using inventory poli-\ncies. Thus, if a company has shelf space for 1000 units, but can get a discount if \nit purchases at least 2000 units, then to get this discount it must expand storage \ncapacity. It can buy or rent additional space.\nThere are options for ordering large quantities to obtain discounts without \nrequiring expanded storage capacity. One of these is vendor releasing, whereby the \nsupplier agrees to deliver small increments of the larger order over time.\nAnother method for reducing storage space requirements is the use of \nco operative storage. Commonly used supplies are ordered at discount in large quan-\ntities, stored in cooperative warehouses, and dispensed to participating hospitals, in \nthe same metropolitan area, on an as-needed basis. Airlines share the storage costs \nand investment-based carrying costs of commonly used parts such as jet engines. \nCooperative sharing reduces storage costs and increases the availability of expensive \ncomponents that require large dollar expenditures.\nItems carried in stock are subject to costs of pilferage, obsolescence, deteriora -\ntion, and damage. These costs represent real losses in the value of inventory. Pilferage, \nwhich is petty theft, is characteristic of small items such as tools. Department stores \nsuffer extensively from stolen merchandize. Hotels lose ashtrays and towels. Pencils \nand stamps disappear in offices.\nObsolescence may be the most important component of carrying cost because \nit happens so often and so fast. Obsolescence occurs quite suddenly because a com-\npetitor introduces technological change. Also, it can be the kind of loss that is asso-\nciated with style goods, toys, and Christmas trees. Out-of-season and out-of-style \nitems can lose value and must be sold at a special reduced rate. The determination \nof how much inventory to carry will be affected by the nature of the inventories and \nthe way in which units lose value over time.\nDeterioration affects the carrying cost of a broad range of products. Industrial \nproducts that deteriorate with advancing age include adhesives, chemicals, textiles, \nand rubber. Weather deteriorates iron and wood. Rubber gaskets in pumps can fail.",

Critics such as Elton Mayo \nhave argued that this method can lead to a decrease in motivation from \nthe employee\u2019s point of view. The main advantage of this style is that the \ndirection of the business will remain constant, and the decisions will all \nbe similar; this in turn can project an image of a confident, well-managed \nbusiness.

What \nmust production know in order to achieve this objective?\nHow can the effects of quality on demand levels be determined? This is equiva -\nlent to asking how to determine the quality\u2013demand volume elasticity. There are \nways in which market research can approach this issue that are similar to the way \nprice\u2013demand volume elasticity is determined. Essentially, it is necessary to estab -\nlish how much extra money customers would be willing to pay for superior qual -\nity or for an added quality feature. By noting the distribution of the additional \namounts of money that people would pay for superior quality or an added feature, \nit is possible to quantify the effects of quality and price on demand elasticity.\nThroughout this discussion, it should be kept in mind that the achievement of \nquality standards is a direct responsibility of P/OM. Although this is a book about \nP/OM and not market research, these functions are highly interdependent. Market \nresearch enables P/OM to determine the kind of connections that link quality, \nprice, and demand elasticity in the customer\u2019s mind.\nThese factors relate design and process decisions with the financial choices that \nare available to the firm. The system interaction includes the fact that quality varies \nwith the kind of equipment that is used, the quality of the material used, and the \namount of training that the employees receive.\n2.4.6 Economies of Scale and the Division of Labor\nEconomies of scale are reductions in variable costs directly related to increasing \nvolumes of production output. Economies of scale are driven by increases in pro -\nduction volume. Scale, as used here, is a surrogate for increasing volume. Total \nvariable cost is both a P/OM and marketing responsibility. Since costs generally \ndecrease with an increasing volume of production, this is also a matter of concern \nfor finance. However, if overtime is used for increasing production volume, the \ncosts may not decrease. The financial decision to use high-volume technology with \ngreater fixed costs is made because the trade-off is lower variable costs.\nVolume is a function of the total market size that exists, the number of com -\npetitors and their shares, and the controllable variables of the organization\u2019s price \nand quality. Although marketing and P/OM work together on the consequences of \nvolume, P/OM is working on the reduction of variable cost which is also a function \nof volume\u2014with no loss in quality.\nMaterials and labor are an important component of the variable per unit cost. \nThe design of the product or service determines what materials are needed. It is \ncommon knowledge that greater purchase volumes generally are rewarded with \ndiscounts. That is only one of the interactions of variable cost and volume. The \nmachines that can be used for high-volume outputs are significantly faster than \nmachines that are economic for low-volume outputs. High volumes can sustain \npre-engineering and improvement studies of the interactions between the design \nof jobs and the processes used, while low volumes cannot. High volumes generate",

The authors present a case study of the design, development, and \nimplementation of an RFID-based traceability system to increase inventory visibil -\nity during the maintenance cycle in order to minimize delays and item misplace -\nments in the maintenance department of an aircraft engineering company. The \ncritical success factors for RFID implementation include: (1) high organizational \nmotivation, (2) implementation process efficiency, (3) effective cost control, and \n(4) RFID skills and knowledge transfer. Several deployment issues that impede \nRFID implementation include: (1) lack of in-house RFID expertise, (2) inadequate \ntechnology support from local RFID vendors, (3) existence of different sets of \nindustry standards, (4) unreliable hardware performance, and (5) underdeveloped \nRFID middleware. Overall, the study reports that the RFID-based traceability \nsystem has resulted in improved lead times, competitive differentiation, savings \nfrom reusing RFID tags, breakthrough productivity by automation, reduction of \nhuman errors in handling the repairable parts, improved inventory management, \nreduced manpower, and manual data recording, real-time monitoring and access \nto detailed information, reduction of repairable parts loss, and improved customer \nrelationships.\nBarratt and Choi (2007) investigate organizational responses to RFID man -\ndates through a case study of a large defense contractor and conclude that the \nresponses of four different business units of the contractor ranged from full compli-\nance to non-compliance or unwillingness to comply. The drivers for the different \nlevels of responses included each unit\u2019s perception of institutional rationalization, \ntechnical rationalization, perceived uncertainty, and internal coupling within the \norganization.\nWhitaker et al. (2007) study the relationships between RFID adoption and fac-\ntors involving financial and IT resources of an organization, the partner mandates, \nand the data standards.

The inventory carrying cost for this price is $0.83 ( =30% of $2.77) per \nunit per year. The EOQ for this price is 4163 (using the EOQ formula). However, \nwe cannot buy 4163 units at the price of $2.77 because the minimum quantity \nspecified by the vendor is 30,000. Therefore, we have to buy at least 30,000 units to \navail of this price discount. We calculate the total cost at this quantity TC (30,000). \nUsing the TC equation:\n \nTC(, ) ,\n,\n,\n.,\n30 000 240 000\n30 000 30 30 000\n2\n08 3 240 0\n= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2217+ \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\u2217+ 000 27 7 677 505 00\u2217= .$ ,. .\nWe now calculate the EOQ for the higher price $2.80.

This example \nillustrates that a quantity discount is accepted only when it lowers the total costs.\nThere are other qualitative factors that need to be considered while making \ndecisions about the order quantity.

However, extra \nchocolate is expensive. Worse yet, if weight and size are inconsistent, the larger \npieces create dissatisfaction with the truffles that meet the standard. Also, consis -\ntency of size is used by customers to judge the quality of the product. Even though \nthe company claims customization as an advantage, complaints are received that \nthe candies are uneven in size and weight. This is an ideal opportunity to use an \nx-bar chart to find out if the chocolate-making process is stable or erratic.\nWeight is easier to measure than size and is considered to be a good surrogate \nfor it. The company wants to test for consistency of product over a production day. \nSamples were taken over the course of one day of production at 10:00 A.M., 11:00 \nA.M., 1:00 P.M., 3:00 P.M., and 4:00 P.M. The hours chosen are just before the \nline is stopped for tea break and/or for cleanup. The sample subgroup size is of four \nconsecutive days with the observations made at the specific times. This yielded 20 \nmeasures and five sample subgroup means.\nFor instructional purposes, this sample is about the right size. For real results, all \nfive days of production for a typical week should be examined. Except as an exam -\nple, a 1-day sample is too small.

The car starts, drives, and does not break \ndown. If the windshield wipers do not work, there is a reliability problem. For \nthe resort, if the room key does not work all of the time, there is a reliability \nproblem.\n \u25fe The conformance  dimension alludes to the degree to which the measured \nproduction qualities correspond to the design quality standards that have \nbeen specified. Windshield wipers are not supposed to fail (say) for the \nfirst five years and the room key is expected to work for a normal stay. \nConformance is definitely the producer\u2019s responsibility (auto and resort \nmanagement).  P/OM is charged with meeting the conformance dimensions \nof quality. These quality standards are specified by the management.\n \u25fe The durability dimension deals with how well the product endures in the face \nof use and stress. Some cars are roadworthy after being driven more than \n100,000 miles. Some room phones fail within a few weeks. Rooms get quite \nshabby with constant use in a few years and customers switch to other hotels \nwhen things get shabby unless prices drop.\n \u25fe The serviceability dimension is related to how often service is required; \nand how difficult, and how costly it is to service and repair the product. \nServiceability for both cars and resort rooms involves the combination of \npreventive and remedial maintenance.\n \u25fe The aesthetics dimension refers to the appearance of the product. For both \nautos and resorts, design styling counts initially, and maintenance is crucial.\n \u25fe The perceived quality  dimension relates to the customers\u2019 perceptions of the \nproduct\u2019s quality and value received for monies paid. This dimension inte -\ngrates the prior seven dimensions with the customers\u2019 sense of value for them. \nMarket research is one of the most important means for determining the \ncustomers\u2019 perceived quality.\nFor different individuals, certain dimensions are more important than others. \nFrequently, there are regional differences in quality perceptions. Hard water areas \nhave their own special quality dimensions for soap. Snow tires have no impact in \nthe Southern states of the U.S.A. Such effects are amplified in the international \nmarketplace. P/OM may have to set different standards for region A as compared \nto region B. Overall, it should be evident that quality definition is enhanced by \nrequiring and enabling a systems perspective. Industrial designers and operations \nmanagers form a powerful team to apply the systems approach to all of the linked \nfactors that relate to the eight quality dimensions.\nAssumptions must be made about the way in which the measurable, physical fac-\ntors relate to the consumers\u2019 evaluations of the \u201cilities\u201d of the product. The \u201cilities\u201d \ninclude utility, dependability, reliability, durability, serviceability, maintainability, \nrepairability, and warrantability. Manufacturability, which includes assembly, is a \nproducer\u2019s concern although it has its effects on the consumers\u2019 \u201cilities.\u201d",

That is a positive benefit of Delphi.\n3.8 Pooling Information and Multiple Forecasts\nMethods for pooling information to provide stronger forecasts should be explored. \nIt is critical that all parties share their forecasts as much as possible and try to find \nways to combine them. Usually, stronger forecasts can be obtained if both data and \nexperience are pooled.\nOne of the keys to success in combining forecasts is trial and error. What seems \nto work is retained and what fails is discarded. As an example of pooling, the results \nof a regression analysis could be augmented by a Delphi-type estimation. In this way, \nexperience and data analysis might be combined to provide a stronger conclusion.\nFormal methods can be used to evaluate how well different forecasting tech -\nniques are doing. At each period, the method that did best the last time is chosen \nfor the forecast that will be followed. Forecasts are still derived from the alternative \nmethods, but they are recorded and not followed. When the actual demand results \nare known, the various forecasting methods are evaluated again, and the one that is \nmost successful is chosen to make the prediction for the next period.\nAveraging of forecast results also is used. The results of taking forecasts from \nmore than one method and averaging these results to predict demand has been \nsuccessful in circumstances where choosing the best method (as described above) \nproduces frequent alteration of the chosen method.\n3.9 Product Life-Cycle Stages and Forecasting\nThroughout the company, the planning function marches to the drumbeat of prod-\nuct life-cycle stages. Operations managers need to be aware of the timing and stages \nthat drive the development schedules of new products (goods and services), as well \nas the production and delivery schedules of the company\u2019s mature products.\nThe product life cycles are composed of four stages that appear in a regular way \nover time. All products and services go through the following stages:\n \u25fe Introduction to the market\n \u25fe Growth of volume and share\n \u25fe Maturation, where maturity is the phase of relative equilibrium\n \u25fe Decline occurs, because of deteriorating sales; decline leads to restaging or \nwithdrawal\nThese life-cycle periods are discrete stages in each product\u2019s life that need to be \nunderstood in order to manage that product.

In other words, successful \ninnovations give rise to competition that can produce severe financial distress for \nthe innovators. The harmful aspect of other beneficial innovations arises when the \noriginal innovator is not ready to counter the competitive onslaught.\nFurther complicating the picture, as more venture capital backs up new prod -\nuct introductions, markets are destabilized. As noted previously, Christensen first \ncalled attention to the powerful effect of \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d (Christensen, \n2002). Production managers must take notice since development of new processes \nis costly and time-consuming, whereas consumers may shift their product loyalties \novernight. In other words, a stable supply system can be disrupted by an unstable \ndemand system. Further, such occurrences of severe destabilization are accelerating \nas powerful competitors make their stand in the global market. P/OM is both the \nchallenger and the challenged. From the point of view of P/OM when challenged \nby innovations coming from outside, managers of operations must be alerted and \nwarned to take nothing for granted.\nChanges of many kinds are occurring faster and faster. There are more com -\npetitors offering an increased variety of choices. A new competitor has a greenfield \nadvantage (i.e., unencumbered by investments in earlier technologies). Older firms \nhave put money into machines and programs that are called legacy technology. \nThe term \u201clegacy\u201d means old and superseded but difficult to replace because of the \nhierarchy of commitments and unamortized capital expenditures. Legacy problems \ndefine the burden of the brownfield competitor who cannot start from \u201cscratch.\u201d\nInnovation is reflected in the rate of change of new technologies replacing old \nlegacy technology . Legacy inheritances (from an earlier management era) are con -\nstraints on innovation. Even if funds can be found to replace old software or hard -\nware (superseded by improved versions) it is often difficult because many employees \nare still committed to using what was once \u201cthe best.\u201d They are comfortable with \nthe old technology. Cost disruptions for retooling and relearning are only part of \nthe trauma of switching from the familiar. The greenfield competitor enters the fray \nwithout the burden of previous commitments that foster hostile attitudes to change.\nSometimes the greenfield technology results in a product that is so superior \nthat customers will purchase it even if it means throwing out old, but functioning, \nproducts. Customers in developing countries may not even have the old products to \nreplace. For example, many places that never had hard-wired telephones\u2014skip over \nthat old technology and go directly to mobile cell phones. Product superiority may \nalso relate to longer product life and fewer failures from age and fatigue.\nInnovation to counter age and fatigue failure is exemplified by new LED lights \nwhich last much longer than the old tungsten bulbs. Though LEDs are more \nexpensive than tungsten bulbs, they save money in power and maintenance costs. \nThey also pollute less than compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). The CFLs represent \na transition step away from tungsten but cannot compete with the LED technology \nas a green alternative.",

Alternatively, the demand figures can be inflated to allow for delivery of \nthe required number of good units. This is often done in the job shop where shorter \nruns occur. In this regard, we will solve our AP problems with the simple assump -\ntion that actual demand is equal to the expected demand and production has no \ndefectives. Discrepancies that arise between the expected and actual demands can \nbe adjusted at the time of the periodic revisions of plans.\nThe first step in developing alternate production plans is to establish a produc -\ntion level per day for each month.

Then to produce 600 units in 22 days,\nProduction level per day = 600/22 = 27.27.\nThe fractional result can be interpreted in various ways. It can be rounded \nup and treated as inventory. Alternatively, it can be completed using overtime. \nWe deal with a production level of 27.27 units as production of 27 units on \nthat given day; then, production continues to work on the unfinished product \non the next day.\nNumber of workers required: The number of workers required on any \ngiven day is a function of the production demand for that day, the number of \nhours worked on that day, and the production time (time required to produce \none unit which is equal to 4 h in our example).\nNumber of workers = (production \u00d7 production time per unit)/hours worked\nIn March suppose each production employee works for 8 h per day and \nrequired production time is 4 h per unit.

The judicious choice of the number of standard deviations to be used is \nan operations management responsibility (in conjunction with other participants) \nbased on the assessment of the two costs stated earlier.

Control charts are used to stabilize \na process and are then used to monitor the process once it has been stabilized.\n8.6.4 Stable Process\nFor quality to be consistent, it must come from a process that is stable, that is, one \nwith fixed parameters. This means that the process average and its standard deviation \nare not shifting. In the case of measurement by attributes a stable system will give a \nconsistent proportion of defective items. The process capability studies are used to \nestablish the limits within which a process can operate. It is important to note that in \nreal production situations, enough data are obtained to create reliable control charts. \nThen, more data are collected to examine whether the process is stable. Initially a sam-\nple of observations is taken and control charts are constructed. Evidence of temporary \ninstability often is thrown out as being associated with start-up conditions. The pro-\ncess is reexamined to see if it has stabilized after the start-up. The initial sample size is \noften 25\u201330 sets of data, followed by another 25\u201330 sets of data. Typically, a data set \nwould consist of 2\u201310 successive observations from which a mean and standard devi-\nation would be determined. A process that is operating without any assignable causes \nof variation is stable by definition, although its variability can be large. Stability does \nnot refer to the degree of variability of a process. Instability reflects the invasion of \nassignable causes of variation, which create quality problems. Once the process is \nconsidered stable, then regular observations are made at scheduled intervals.\n8.6.5 Selecting a Manufacturing Process\nAfter the design of a product is complete, an appropriate manufacturing process \nis to be selected.

The slope of the line is represented by b which \ngives the change in the value of demand (variable Y ) for a unit change in the value \nof X. That is, b is the amount by which demand will change if the independent \nvariable changes by one unit.\nWe can use the Excel program\u2019s built-in functions to find the values of a (inter-\ncept) and b (slope).

Therefore, before we even determine the regression equa-\ntion, it is important to find out whether there exists a relationship between X and \nY. The scatter diagrams visually displays the relationships between X and Y. Scatter \ndiagrams are useful visual aids to find whether there is a relationship between X and \nY. Figures 3.8 and 3.9 are the scatter diagrams for two different data series. It is easy \nto see that there is a relationship between X and Y in Figure 3.8, whereas Figure 3.9 \nshows very little relationship. These relationships can also be established in quan -\ntitative terms by calculating the correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient ( r) \nshows the extent of correlation of X with Y, where r can take on values from \u20131 to \n+1. At \u20131, X and Y are perfectly correlated\u2014going in opposite directions. As X gets \nlarge, Y gets small, and vice versa. When r = 0, there is no correlation and when \nr = +1, X and Y are perfectly correlated going in the same direction.

They also provide \nthe opportunity to improve the productivity of these processes.\nHowever, it is essential to obtain good forecasts about timing when the mar -\nket equilibrium is deteriorating. Market share deteriorates slowly at first and then \nseverely when the tipping point is reached. Suddenly, the production system is using \nmaterials and labor to make a product or deliver a service that no one wants. What \nhas triggered this state of affairs? Was the handwriting on the wall? Could Polaroid \nhave forecast the digital camera? The interesting and conclusive answer is \u201cyes.\u201d In \nevery one of the cases previously mentioned, with proper methods and clear vision, \nforecasting could have seen what was coming even though the cause of the problem \ncould not have been anticipated and the timing prediction might have been flawed.\nThe Pan Am case provides an interesting example. Pan Am flight 103 on \nWednesday, 21 December 1988 was destroyed by a bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland \nkilling all 259 people on board the plane. The effect on bookings was immediate \nand the continued publicity barrage kept negative associations uppermost in future \nflyers\u2019 minds. It cannot be known if Pan Am could have reversed the revenue decay \nbut many have supposed that creative efforts on a grand scale might have suc -\nceeded. What is known is that Pan Am\u2019s management tried to wait it out without \nforecasting the inevitable bankruptcy that would occur when load factors fell below \nbreakeven. Production planning for a period of very low occupancy might have \nconserved enough cash to weather the storm. Forecasting played no part in Pan \nAm\u2019s planning after the catastrophe.\nBy current definitions, this bombing was a black swan event which is an occur -\nrence that is very rare, unexpected, and even impossible. In the sixteenth century, \nblack swans were presumed not to exist. Later, it was realized that black swans are \nvery rare but they do occur in nature. The Black Swan theory of forecasting is relevant \nto many situations (such as the Chicago Tylenol unsolved murders\u2014these poisonings \noccurred in 1982). Johnson & Johnson made a major P/OM decision to redesign the \npackage and to publicize with extensive marketing expenditures their new quality \ncontrol (safety) measures. The Tylenol case is often cited because J&J used forecasts \nto correctly redirect marketing efforts and P/OM strategies. Disaster was avoided \nand crisis management was totally successful. When established product designs and \nbrands (such as Keuffel & Esser slide rules, RCA 45 rpm vinyl records, 3.25 floppy \ndisk drives, and Kodak 35-mm films) disappear in the market, it is essential to note \nthat many producers were surprised but very few consumers were surprised.\nSummary\nStrategic planning requires teamwork. P/OM should be part of the team. Chapter \n3 discusses P/OM\u2019s role in helping to develop strategies and illuminates P/OM\u2019s \nassignment to carry them out.

The job \nis not tardy and therefore its tardiness is zero. In this way, the completion time and \ntardiness of all jobs are completed.\nIn general, the completion time and tardiness are calculated using the following \nequations:\n Completion time = Start time + Processing time.\n Tardiness  = Completion time \u2212 Due date.\nHowever, the tardiness equation may give a negative number. For example, \nusing this equation, the tardiness of job A = 17 \u2013 45 = \u221228. When there is a nega -\ntive tardiness, we make it zero.

In \nother words, the capacity constraints can be written as\n X11 + X12 + X13 + X14 = 20,000 (Miami Plant)\n X21 + X22 + X23 + X24 = 40,000 (Tempe Plant)\n X31 + X32 + X33 + X34 = 30,000 (Columbus Plant)\nNote: If the total capacity of all three plants together is greater than the total \ndemand, then the \u201c = \u201d sign in the above constraints will be replaced by \u201c \u2264.\u201d This \nmeans that capacity of one or more plants will not be fully utilized.\nDemand constraints: Total shipments received at MKG, Inc. are: X11 + X21 + X31. \nThis total should be equal to 25,000 (demand at MKG, Inc.). In other words, the \ndemand constraints can be written as\n X11 + X21 + X31 = 25,000 (MKG, Inc.)\n X12 + X22 + X32 = 13,500 (ASN, Inc.)",

Similarly, if n = 4, then \nthe forecast cannot be made for the first four periods.\nThe term \u201cmoving average\u201d is used because as each new observation becomes avail-\nable a new average can be computed and used as a forecast. No forecast can be made \nuntil there are as many historical observations as are needed (n) for the MA. Further \nthe method of MA is used to forecast only one time period in advance because of \nnonavailability of actual values needed to forecast more than one period in advance.\nA decision must be made concerning how many data values should be included \nin the MA set (n). Is it better to use two, three, four, or more periods? The quest is \nto find the optimal number of prior periods to include in the MA series. How far \nback to go depends on the speed with which the series changes and the recency of \nevents that tend to determine the future. \u201cVery recent\u201d means few values; \u201cnot so \nrecent\u201d means more values. That is a workable rule of thumb. The MA method is \nused when the demand for a product is fairly constant over time and does not have \na rapid growth rate or seasonal characteristics. The method is primarily useful in \nremoving the random fluctuations in the historical data. When the magnitude of \nthe trend is great, and the pattern is very consistent, then the fewer the number of \nperiods (n) in the set the better it is. If the trend is slow (up or down), and if fluctua-\ntions around the average are common, then having more periods of time in the set \nis better than having too few. In selecting the value of n, there are many conflicting \neffects. The larger the value of n, the greater is the effect of smoothing any random \nvariation. Smoother value may be desirable if there is a lot of randomness in the \nhistorical data or if there is little change in the underlying pattern. On the other \nhand, if the underlying pattern in the data is changing, that is, there is a trend in \nthe data either increasing the demand or decreasing it, then a small value of n may \nbe desirable if we want to react to fluctuations more rapidly. In such cases, the MA \nbased on a large value of n has the adverse characteristic of lagging the trend. With \na short value of n, the follow up of the trend will be rapid. A shorter value of n may \nalso be used where there is little randomness in the observed data. The large and \nsmall values of n vary around 36 and 6, respectively.\nIn general, an n-month moving average is the sum of the observed values dur-\ning the past n months divided by n.",

The reli -\nability-engineering organization must be consistent with the company\u2019s \norganizational structure. For small, noncritical systems, reliability engi -\nneering may be informal. As complexity grows, the need arises for a formal \nreliability function. Because reliability is important to the customer, the \ncustomer may even specify certain aspects of the reliability organization.\nThere are several common types of reliability organizations. The project \nmanager or chief engineer may employ one or more reliability engineers \ndirectly. In larger organizations, there is usually a product assurance or \nspecialty-engineering organization, which may include reliability, main -\ntainability, quality, safety, human factors, logistics, and so on. In such \ncase, the reliability engineer reports to the product assurance manager or \nspecialty-engineering manager.\nIn some cases, a company may wish to establish an independent reli -\nability organization. This is desirable to ensure that the system reliability, \ntesting of which is often expensive and time-consuming, is not unduly \nslighted due to budget and schedule pressures. In such cases, the reliabil -\nity engineer works on the project on a day-to-day basis, but is actually \nemployed and paid by a separate organization within the company.\nBecause reliability engineering is critical to early system design, it has \nbecome common for reliability engineers; however, the organization is \nstructured to work as part of an integrated product team.\nCertification\nThe American Society for Quality (ASQ) has a program to become a \n \ncertified reliability engineer, or CRE. Certification is based on education, \nexperience, and a certification test; periodic recertification is required. The \nbody of knowledge for the test includes reliability management, design \nevaluation, product safety, statistical tools, design and development, \n \nmodeling, reliability testing, collecting and using data, and so on.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Task selection depends on the \ncriticality of the system as well as cost. A critical system may require a \nformal failure-reporting and failure review process throughout develop -\nment, whereas a noncritical system may rely on final test reports. The most \ncommon reliability program tasks are documented in reliability program \nstandards, such as MIL-STD-785 (U.S. Air Force 1986) and IEEE 1332 \n(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 1998).\nd\nesign for \nr\neliability\nDesign for reliability (DFR) is an emerging discipline that refers to the \nprocess of designing reliability into products. This process encompasses \nseveral tools and practices, and describes the order of their deployment \nthat an organization needs to have in place in order to drive reliability \ninto their products. Typically, the first step in the DFR process is to set the \nsystem\u2019s reliability requirements. Reliability must be \u201cdesigned into\u201d the \nsystem. During system design, the top-level reliability requirements are \nthen allocated to subsystems by design and reliability engineers working \ntogether.\nReliability design begins with the development of a model. Reliability \nmodels use block diagrams and fault trees to provide a graphical means of \n \nevaluating the relationships between different parts of the system. These \nmodels incorporate predictions based on parts-count failure rates taken \nfrom\n \nhistorical data. While the predictions are often not accurate in an \nabsolute sense, they are valuable to assess relative differences in design \nalternatives.\nFault \nt\nree \nd\niagrams\nOne of the most important design techniques is redundancy. This means \nthat if one part of the system fails, there is an alternate success path, \nsuch as a backup system. An automobile brake light might use two light \nbulbs. If one bulb fails, the brake light still operates using the other bulb. \nRedundancy significantly increases system reliability, and is often the only \nviable means of doing so. However, redundancy is difficult and expensive, \nand is therefore limited to critical parts of the system. Another design \ntechnique, the physics of failure, relies on understanding the physical pro-\ncesses of stress, strength, and failure at a very detailed level.

The function goes back to the \nearliest days of systematic production and assignment of service jobs to work crews.\nThe quote with which we began this chapter from the writer Annie Dillard \ncaptures the point that schedules prevent operating under chaotic conditions and \nmistaken whimsy. Scheduling methods are designed to bring order and efficiency \nto the work process. They are also a sensible way to deal properly with what counts. \nStephen Covey (www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/07/16/the-7-habits/) stated, \n\u201cThe key is not to prioritize what\u2019s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.\u201d\nThe Gantt load chart was developed in early 1900\u2019s, and it is still used. Loading \ndecisions concern which jobs are to be assigned to which teams or facilities. Jobs \non-hand are relatively risk-free to schedule. Jobs that are on the books as fore -\ncasts are problematic. Depending on the real situation, they may not be scheduled \nbecause there is too high a risk of cancellation.\nLoading is nonspecific to job order, so it is always followed by sequencing and \nscheduling. The classification scheme for scheduling based on various criteria is \ndiscussed. There is strong methodology to determine the best order for job process-\ning. Which job goes first, second, and so on? Service system managers often require \nfirst-come, first-serve so that their customers do not get upset. The same applies to \nproduction deliveries. Customer systems are criticized when the \u201cfairness criterion\u2019\u2019 \n[first-in, first-out (FIFO)] is violated. Nevertheless, the alternative of processing \norders so that SPTs go first provides benefits to everyone except those who regularly \nhave orders that take a long time to process. Choosing the criteria is a systems prob-\nlem that should reflect the basic values of the organization.\nGantt layout charts are used to organize sequencing assignments. The sequenc -\ning situation depends on the number of jobs ( n) and the number of machines ( m) \nthat are available to work on the jobs. Solution methods differ according to the \nnumber of facilities (machines, m). Various scheduling rules are developed for \n single-machine problems. Johnson\u2019s rule is described for the two-machine flow-ship \nproblems. The problems of dynamic scheduling are also discussed.\nReview Questions\n 1. Describe the loading function.\n 2. Explain a Gantt chart.\n 3. What is a flow shop?\n 4. Distinguish between flow and job shops.\n 5. When does FIFO make sense as a sequencing rule?\n 6. When does LIFO make sense as a sequencing rule?\n 7. When should SPT be used?",

There will be low volume with a quite \nhigh price for such demand.\nAdaptability is critical when product design technology (or style) changes.

Five-and-a-quarter \nfloppy disks have disappeared, and 3.5-inch floppy disks have been largely superseded \nby memory cards, flash sticks, etc. What is coming next is a forecasting challenge.\nHayes and Pisano (1994) observe that strategic flexibility becomes the strategic \ngoal in a turbulent environment and state that, \u201cBeing world-class is not enough; a \ncompany also has to have the capability to switch gears\u2014from, for example, rapid \nproduct development to low cost\u2014relatively quickly and with minimum resources. \nThe job of manufacturing is to provide that capability.\u201d\nThe lesson to learn from all of these cases is that productivity excellence is use -\nless without market acceptance. P/OM strategic thinking is \u201cfind the best product \nline for the marketplace, and then make it at the lowest cost, highest quality, and \noverall at max productivity levels.\u201d As Peter Drucker is quoted to have said, \u201cDo \nthe right thing, and then do the thing right.\u201d Strategy planning for operations is \ndirectly concerned with \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d\nProduct design and product development lead, respectively, to process design \nand process development. Product and process are both components of the strategic \nimperatives for P/OM. Output as inventory that cannot be sold is unproductive \nand cannot be counted while measuring productivity.\n2.3 Measurement of Productivity\nProductivity is a critical business variable that directly impacts the \u201cbottom line\u201d; \nimproved productivity raises net profits. P/OM is responsible for the productivity of \nthe process. This is such a critical factor in a company\u2019s overall strategy that excel -\nlence in productivity achievement is a major P/OM issue.\nProductivity is a system property that interacts with other system properties \nsuch as reliability and consistency, as well as customers\u2019 perceptions of quality. It \ninteracts with the variable costs of goods and services, as well as with the fixed costs \nof facilities, training, and technology. It also interacts with the presence and the \navailability of management as a resource. It is often found that output rates and \nqualities (and therefore productivity) are better on regular work shifts as compared \nto \u201cgraveyard\u201d shifts because managers are scarce resources for the latter.",

That is why \nbidding models rely on probabilistic analyses. To be proficient with auctions and \nbidding requires skills not normally associated with the proper education of an \noperations manager.\nHedging is another form of bidding and a game of chance. When the hedge \nworks out, heroes are made. Here is how the hedge works: Delta Airlines buys \u201cker-\nosene futures\u201d which means paying today\u2019s prices for delivery in, say, 6 months. If \nthe price of kerosene has gone up in 6 months, then Delta saves money. The reverse \nis true if the price in 6 months is less than it is at time the hedge is completed. In \nfact, Delta Airlines did a successful hedge because they predicted that kerosene \ncosts would escalate when they did zoom. In fact, Delta also stopped hedging at \nthe proper time. Hedging is viewed by many as necessary and intelligent gambling. \nThat has never been part of the profile of a successful operations manager but it \nhas been associated with the best PAs. It is vital that operations managers and PAs \nwork together.\nBidding models show that as the number of bidders competing for a specific job \nincreases, the size of the winning bid decreases. That is both apparent and logical. \nWith more bidders, variability increases and so does competition. Perhaps this is \na good reason for buyers to include many bidders. On the other hand, each extra \nbid adds to the ordering costs. There also is the fear that a low bid will be made by \nan organization that is less likely to produce quality work. Steps must be taken to \nensure that quality is not compromised by price. Also, too many bidders may drive \nthe expected profit so low that qualified suppliers refuse to join the bidding, leaving \nthe field open to the less qualified.\nA company may not choose to buy from the organization presenting the lowest \nbid. Price is almost never the only factor that needs to be taken into consideration \nwhen awarding a contract. Among other things, it is essential to consider qual -\nity and guarantees of quality, the experience of the supplier, the uncertainties of \ndelivery, and the kind of long-term, supplier\u2013producer relationship that is likely to \ndevelop. Certification may be required before a supplier is allowed to participate in \na bidding contest.\nBidding is applicable for project procurement policies and for start-up purchase \narrangements for the flow shop where the volume of materials is large. It is less rel -\nevant for the job shop, although it may make sense when costly components and/\nor relatively big batches are involved. Bidding is a useful protection when there \nis suspicion that special purchasing deals are being made between suppliers and \ncompany personnel.\n9.6  Certification of Suppliers\nCertification of suppliers is a process for grading suppliers to ensure that suppliers\u2019 \norganizations conform to standards that are essential for meeting the buyer\u2019s needs.",

Materials flow downstream and orders flow upstream. Information flows \nin both directions.\nThere are several decisions that have to be made in designing this supply chain. \nThe manufacturer can ship the product directly to the retailer or have intermedi -\nate partners like wholesalers and distributors. The manufacturer may even choose \nto use an e-channel in which the customers place orders online and the product is \ndelivered directly to the customers without any intermediaries. Many combina -\ntions are used. The \u201cproduct\u201d dictates the design to a large extent at this stage. For \nexample, orders for products like TVs, computers, furniture, books, etc. can be \nplaced online (e-channel or e-tailing) and the product is delivered directly to the \ncustomer. Whereas, for alcoholic beverages like wine, beer, whisky, etc., a consumer \nmay not be able to buy directly from a manufacturer due to government regulations \n(the rules vary from state to state in the United States). The e-channel is becoming \npopular with advances in Internet technology. Amazon is an example of a highly \nsuccessful e-tailer. This alternative is discussed in more detail in the section on \ne-business.\nThe manufacturer also has to decide the numbers of wholesalers, distributors, \nand the retailers. The network for the flow of goods has to be designed. A decision \nis to be made about the location of the manufacturing plant or multiple plants. \nThe locations of the supply chain partners have to be determined. The chapter on \nlocation has discussed various techniques for making location decisions. In a supply \nchain, the relative location of these partners is important because that establishes \nthe distribution network and affects the cost of goods transported.\nThe manufacturer also has to decide the means of transportation: trucks, trains, \nairplanes, ships, etc. The choice depends on the product and the cost of transporta-\ntion. For example, perishable products like fresh food items may have to be trans -\nported by air. Refrigerated trucking is another popular option.\nIn case trucks are used for transportation, should the manufacturer own the \ntrucks or use a trucking company? This is an important decision and affects cost. \nOwning the trucks increases the fixed costs, whereas using a trucking company \nincreases the operational (variable) cost. The trucking company has to achieve a \nprofit and this must also influence the financial decisions.\nSee the breakeven analysis in Appendix A.

Nevertheless, with the Level plan, both overstock \nand out-of-stock situations occur in spite of ending the year with zero inventories.\nThe inventory and shortage costs in each month are calculated by multiplying \nthe end of month inventory or shortage by the respective costs. Alternatively, we can \ntotal the end-of-month inventories (sum of all end-of-month inventories = 697) and \nalso total the end-of-month shortages (sum of all end-of-month shortages = 465). \nMultiply these numbers by their respective costs.

The production \nper day changes from 1 month to the next. This is called \u201cChase plan\u201d because pro-\nduction chases (matches) demand. The details of this plan are given in Table 4.9. In \nthis plan, there are no inventories or shortages. However, the production level has \nto be adjusted in each month. In January, the production level is 18.18 units per \nday. Therefore, the production level is reduced by 2.82 (21 \u2212 18.18) units, assum-\ning that the plant is currently set up to produce 21 units per day. In February, the \nproduction level increases to 22 and the level has to be adjusted upward by 3.82 \n(level in February \u2212 level in January = 22 \u2212 18.18) units.\nAs shown in Table 4.9, the production levels have to be adjusted upwards in \nMarch (5.27), May (5.14), June (3.73), July (1.75), August (0.07), November (2.33), \nand December (8.00). The numbers in parentheses show the amount of upward \nadjustments. In January, April, September, and October, the production levels \nhave to be adjusted down by 2.82, 8.42, 9.09 and 3.79, respectively.

Information flows throughout the supply \nchain are subject to oligopolistic conditions. Supply chains cannot function with -\nout free-flowing but private information. For example, in many cases, the prices to \nbe offered in bidding cannot be made public until the bidding is concluded.\nBidding by government agencies is usually standardized. Thus, the IRS sought \nand reviewed bids for updating its computer systems. The armed services utilize bids \nfor military acquisitions. Bids are familiar in situations where industrial firms have \nno prior supplier arrangements and in which costly purchases (including engineer -\ning and construction jobs) are to be made. The federal government usually awards \ncontracts to the lowest bidder subject to a set of external standards. Qualitative \nconcerns that are taken into account by private industry are seldom permitted with \ngovernment awards. Properly, this will change when P/OM is able to present the big \nsystems picture to the watchdog agencies.\nBids can be requested where the price is fixed and the creativity and quality of \nthe solution is at stake. Advertising agencies bid for accounts that have a set bud -\nget. Alternative bids are based on campaign creativity. The same applies to a P/OM \nrequest for proposals from a consulting organization where the budget allocation is \nfixed. Competing bids for computerized materials management systems are common.\nWith so much bidding action, it is not surprising that bidding (decision) mod -\nels have been developed. Experienced e-Bay bidders use decision model software \nto guide them. Sniping is entering a bid at the last minute (or better yet, the last \n10 seconds) to prevail at the moment further bidding ceases. The key is to prevent \nothers from having further time to react. There are sniping services (such as eSnipe) \navailable for a price on the web. There are selling strategies as well. Various small \ncompanies are auction-oriented participants in the supply chain. DealDash has \ndeveloped a seller\u2019s strategy on TV that promises \u201ceasy to win, fair, and honest \nauctions.\u201d Many variations exist such as Dutch auctions (named after the method \nused for Dutch tulip auctions) start with a high price and gradually lower it until \nsomeone accepts a price which becomes the winning bid. Google used the Dutch \nauction technique to sell its stock to the public. The US Treasury uses Dutch auc -\ntions to sell securities as do many other countries.\nDevelopments in information technology have facilitated an increasing use of \nthe Internet for e-auctions. See Gupta et al. (2009) for a detailed discussion of \ne-auctions. e-Auctions can be used for consumer-to-consumer (C2C) and business-\nto consumer (B2C) auctions through commercial vendors like eBay and Yahoo! \nThe e-commerce vendors such as FreeMarkets have focused on business-to-business \n(B2B) and e-procurement auctions. e-Auctions have become popular for both for -\nward auctions and reverse auctions. Several buyers compete and bid for one seller\u2019s \ngood(s) or service(s) in forward auctions, whereas several sellers compete and bid to \nfulfill the order of one buyer in the reverse auction systems.\nThere are many varieties of auctions that exist. Buying and selling in this way \nrequires knowledge of the value of items being purchased as well as the auction",

The scoring model permits the simultaneous \nevaluation of tangible and intangible costs. The method allows intangibles to be \ndealt with in a quantitative fashion with as many factors considered as seem neces -\nsary. However, the most practical idea is to concentrate on the important factors.\nThere can be multiple decision makers in making location decisions. Each man-\nager on the site-selection team will provide individual ratings (numbers) for all of \nthe factors. If averages are used to combine the preference scores and the weights, \nthe effect would be to decrease the differentials between locations. Averaging the \nscores of multiple decision makers reduces variability. This is because individual \nextremes tend to cancel each other. If averaging is used, the results can be compared \nwith the results for the individuals. The managers can identify problems and areas \nto be further studied by comparing their preference scores and weights.\nScoring models organize a lot of information that is relevant for location decisions. \nManagers can study what is known and what is not; what is agreed upon, and what is \nnot; what is important and what is not; whether consensus exists about what is impor-\ntant; what appears to require additional research, etc. Ultimately, the decision has to be \nmade about accepting or rejecting the solution indicated by the scoring model.\nPooling and polling opinions of many people in the company about location \ndecisions increases involvement and builds pride in the company.

If the company intends to relo-\ncate employees who are willing to make the move\u2014at least to certain places, this \napproach provides positive motivation.\nInformation about the choices should be made available throughout the com -\npany.

Old text books (and managers) were used to a different \nenvironment. It was one in which there was time to enjoy the stability of market \nequilibriums. However, as technology moves from incipient to mature quickly, the \ngreenfield advantage disappears. What Chan and Mauborgne (of INSEAD) call \ntraditional (red ocean) strategy comes into play. Red oceans are swarming with \ncompetitors trying to gain advantage by cutting costs and grabbing a few points \nof market share. That does define a huge portion of business strategy (Kim, 2005).\nIn contrast, these authors call for methods to discover blue oceans which are \nrelatively untapped (uncontested) market spaces. They give examples including \nAustralian wine (Yellow Tail), Callaway Golf, Cirque de Soleil, and Southwest \nAirlines. Finding new ways to do things can be profitable, at least for a while. \nCompetitors turn blue oceans red quickly. Apple enjoyed iPhone blue ocean domi-\nnance for a short time only because Samsung was quick to imitate and improve.\nAn excellent example of P/OM providing blue ocean innovative capabilities lies \nin the field of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). The definition of CLSC requires \nunderstanding the systems breadth of the entire life cycle management of products \nand services (Guide Jr., 2009). The NPD platform must be viewed as spanning \nthe creation of the family of products as well as the renewing and restaging of all \nmembers of the family.

In this regard, it is to be noted that Japanese firms \ntypically rely heavily on their suppliers and part-time help. Other aspects of \nJapanese manufacturing methods also logically account for world-class productiv -\nity accomplishments.\nNevertheless, the phenomenal Japanese productivity records have diminished \nsubstantially in recent years. Other leading industrial nations have experienced \nproductivity declines. Many hypotheses have been offered to explain the inabil -\nity to sustain stable productivity growth in a turbulent era of new technological \ndevelopment. One suggestion, by Baumol et al. (1991), is that the productiv -\nity of industrial nations is converging to a global mean. Another, by Forrester \n(1978), is that old technology gets used up, and it is difficult to switch to the new \ntechnologies and make them profitable. It also takes smarter management. In \nspite of this, the US economy shows many signs of increased productivity while \nreducing the manufacturing labor force and increasing the service sector labor \nforce (Table 2.1).\nThe outsourcing of services has become familiar. Outsourced call centers pro -\nvide an excellent example of a global phenomenon. Calls originating in Bellevue, \nIowa, may be answered by English-speaking operators in Bangalore, India. When \noutsourcing is used in a proper way, productivity does go up. Usually, input costs \nare reduced more than output rates. What is lost in the simple ratio measure is the \ndamage to long-term loyalty.\nCompetitors keep jockeying and leapfrogging each other with the adoption of \nnew technologies that initially reduce productivity. There are various causes for the \nreduction. The new technology is imposed on old processes by employees who lack \ntraining and experience with the new technology.\nProduct life is short. This allows little time to enjoy the advantages of new tech-\nnology applied to evanescent and even obsolescent product lines. Quality deteriora-\ntion is an almost hidden enemy of productivity when defectives are created global \ndistances away from the managers who are responsible for carrying out strategic \nplans. Speed to remedy weaknesses is also impaired.\nIncreasingly, companies buy from suppliers located around the world and sell \nin markets that are equally dispersed. Production facilities, including fabrication, \nassembly, chemical and drug processes, and service facilities (e.g., call centers), are \nlocated globally. In the big picture, productivity performance is the result of inter -\nnational interactions. If productivity is being measured in dollars, or local curren -\ncies, exchange rate problems can distort the picture.

This means that at least 99.72% of the output will be of acceptable qual-\nity. On the other hand, the UCL (2.075) and LCL (1.925) of process B lie outside \nthe USL (2.05) and LSL (1.95).\nTherefore, some items produced by process B will fall outside the USL and \nLSL. By definition, these items will be considered defective. Process A is more \naccurate and precise as compared to process B and hence process A is likely to \nbe more expensive. Process B is less expensive but produces more defective units. \nAn appropriate process is selected after doing a careful analysis of the costs of \nthe processes and the cost of rejected units which might have to be scrapped if \nthey cannot be reworked.

This makes it easier to experiment with past data to see which value of \n\u03b1 provides the least forecast error. Often, the use of the ES method for forecasting \nis preferred to the WMA method.\nThe response rate of the ES model is a function of the \u03b1 value that is used. The \nresponse rate of a forecasting system is the speed with which the forecasting sys -\ntem makes adjustments to the forecasts if the data in the series show an upward or \ndownward trend. A review of the two equations stated above provides a perspective \non the response rate. Consider the first equation, Forecast (t) = \u03b1 * Actual demand \n(t \u2212 1) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) * Forecast (t \u2212 1). When \u03b1 is large, the actual demand in the prior \nperiod is given great weight in the forecast for the next period. If \u03b1 is 1, the forecast \nfor the next period is the actual value of the prior period (same as n = 1 in MA). The \nforecast results are markedly affected by the \u03b1 that is used.\nThe second equation, Forecast ( t) = Forecast ( t \u2212 1) + \u03b1 * {Actual demand \n(t \u2212 1)\u2013Forecast (t \u2212 1)}, provides a different perspective on the ES technique. The \nforecast in period t is equal to the forecast in the previous period plus a fraction \n(specified by \u03b1) of the error in the previous period. The error in the previous period \nis the difference between that actual demand and the forecast, which can be posi -\ntive or negative. If \u03b1 is close to 0, the new forecast does not show much adjustment \nfor the error, and in the extreme case, if \u03b1 = 0, the new forecast is equal to the old \nforecast with no adjustments.\nSmall values of \u03b1 (which will be analogous to large values of n in MA) are used \nfor stable systems where there is, at most, a minimum amount of random fluctua -\ntion. Large values of \u03b1 are used for changing and evolving systems where much reli-\nance is placed on the last observation. New products, as they move through their \nlife-cycle stages, start with a large \u03b1 value, which gradually diminishes as the prod-\nuct enters its maturation stage. For most production scheduling systems in both the \njob shop and the flow shop, \u03b1 is kept small, in the neighborhood of 0.050\u20130.150, to \ndecrease the system\u2019s response to random fluctuations.\nThe ES method has a clear advantage over the MA method in terms of the \namount of memory required for storing the data. In addition to the smoothing con-\nstant \u03b1, at any time we need to store only the exponentially smoothed average and \nthe actual demand for the previous period. For the MA method, actual demands \nfor the last n periods have to be stored.\nThe different values of \u03b1 give different forecast just like different forecasts are \nobtained by changing the values of n in the MA method. A small value of \u03b1 makes \nminor adjustments to the forecast results as discussed above\u2014giving smoother \nforecasts. A smooth forecast is obtained in the MA method if n is large. Therefore, \nsmaller values of \u03b1 and large values of n tend to give similar forecasts. Similarly, \nlarge values of \u03b1 and small values of n tend to give similar results. In fact, when \n\u03b1 = 1, or n = 1, the forecast in a given period is equal to the demand in the previ -\nous period and the forecasting system is extremely responsive to changes in the \ndemand. In this case, the forecast fluctuates as actual demand fluctuates. However, \nforecasts are lagging behind the demand by one period.",

Patient evaluation of the permanency of \ncommon causes is easy to counsel, but hard to realize in the face of possible stock \noutages and unhappy customers, retailers, and distributors. Still, it seems reason -\nable to caution about the illusion of sustained common causes.\nThe producer could not resist and invested in more capacity. The final episode \nin this scenario is that the cause of the increased demand at the retail level was \ntemporary. It was a common cause, such as might be created by a sensational TV \nprogram or a published newspaper article about the product. In reality, the glam -\nour and appeal were gradually forgotten, and the special selling effects eventually \ndisappeared.\nThe producer now has more capacity than is likely to be used for a long time, if \never. The producer drops the price to be able to sell everything that its new capacity \nenables it to make. The distributor orders more to take advantage of the probable \nincrease in demand that follows a drop in price. The retailer also is working on \nlower margins and prefers to push the competitive products.\nIn the simulation game, the product can be beer or soft drinks, cosmetics, or \nfood. Supply chains can be extended to industrial products for OEMs. The basic \nidea of linked supply and demand is valid as long as the relevant supply chain has \nbeen identified.\n9.12  Bullwhip Effect\nThe bullwhip effect refers to amplified demand variability in a supply chain. It has \nbeen observed in many industries that even if the variability in demand (orders \nby customers) is low at the retailer level, more variability is observed in the orders \nplaced by the upstream supply chain partners to replenish their inventories. In \nother words, the orders by a retailer to its wholesaler to replenish the stock are likely \nto fluctuate more than the demand at the retailer. This phenomenon continues \nup the supply chain. The bullwhip phenomenon was first identified by Proctor \nand Gamble (P&G). In the words of Lee et al. (1997), \u201cNot long ago, logistics \nexecutives at Procter & Gamble (P&G) examined the order patterns for one of \ntheir best-selling products, Pampers. Its sales at retail stores were fluctuating, but \nthe variabilities were certainly not excessive. However, as they examined the dis -\ntributors\u2019 orders, the executives were surprised by the degree of variability. When \nthey looked at P&G\u2019s orders of materials to their suppliers, such as 3M, they dis -\ncovered that the swings were even greater. At first glance, the variabilities did not \nmake sense. While the consumers, in this case, the babies, consumed diapers at \na steady rate, the demand order variabilities in the supply chain were amplified \nas they moved up the supply chain. P&G called this phenomenon the \u2018bullwhip\u2019 \neffect. (In some industries, it is known as the \u2018whiplash\u2019 or the \u2018whipsaw\u2019 effect.)\u201d \nLee et al.

We have divided the SCM system into three parts: \nacquisition chain, transformation process, and distribution chain. The foci of this \nchapter are on the acquisition chain and the distribution chain.\nThe acquisition chain is concerned with acquiring materials, component parts, \nsupplies, and services so that a manufacturer can produce the desired product. We \nspent a major portion of this discussion on sourcing and purchasing.\nPurchasing is a crucial player on the MM team. It can take advantage of the \nglobal reach provided by expanding telecommunications technologies.

The IT component of the credit card business model is almost trans -\nparent, but it is still very difficult to do well with consistent performance. These \nproduction processes are good examples of information systems operating under \nhigh-volume flow shop conditions.\nDisaster (crisis) management, another service area, is an emerging field within \nthe realm of P/OM. A disaster can be man-made through error and/or terror; or \nnature-driven such as flooding, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcanic erup -\ntions. With an increase in the frequency of disasters\u2014both natural and man-\nmade\u2014the importance of crisis management has increased. First responders to \ncrises must cope with needs of people buried, injured, starving, thirsty, and requir -\ning shelter. They need supplies and equipment. In this instance, crisis management \nanticipates needs before they arise based on understanding the type of disaster that \nis predicted. Dealing with the aftermaths of tragedies requires a priori analysis of \nsupply chains to deliver healthcare and subsistence. This point of view is under -\nstandable since alleviating human suffering deserves top priority.\nFrom a systems perspective, the anticipation of catastrophes can sometimes \nresult in mitigation of damage. Under some circumstances, it can even prevent the \ncatastrophe from occurring. P/OM concepts can be used during various phases of \ncatastrophic events. Various phases include anticipating and stopping catastrophes, \nmitigating catastrophes, and preparing for catastrophes.\nP/OM procedures can stop catastrophes. There is no record of how many disas-\nters did not occur because good operational procedures detected problems and cor-\nrected them before calamities resulted. There are, however, numerous instances of \nwhere official reports confirmed that correctable conditions were detected but the \ncorrections were not made in time and disaster resulted.\nAs is later discussed in Chapter 11 (where sustainability is the P/OM topic \nunder consideration), operational procedures did not require a delay in the \nChallenger space shot (STS-51-L) on January 28, 1986. Postponement should have \nbeen required because O-ring conditions had not been tested nor certified in very \nlow temperatures which prevailed on that day.\nMany other examples can be cited including Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-107) \nwhich experienced vehicle disintegration on February 1, 2003. Learning from this \nevent, design changes were instituted which would prevent similar tragedies from \noccurring in future space launchings. The list of preventable accidents is extremely \nlarge and further examples will be presented in Chapter 11 and other suitable parts \nof this textbook.\nP/OM can control impact severity. Bringing to bear mobile firefighters and \nequipment of sufficient capacity to manage forest wildfires has helped reduce the \nsize of the burning areas. Similarly, taking steps to build up walls of sandbags has \nhelped limit damage in many flood areas. P/OM is well known for bringing ade -\nquate supplies to staging areas before catastrophic events occur. Thus, Home Depot \nhad repair supplies on the move from dozens of states in the USA before hurricane",

The third is the input of international partners who \nunderstand the real estate issues as well as the governmental regulations.\nLocation decision models can use measures of costs and preferences to reach \nlocation decisions. Transportation models (TMs) use costs, and scoring models use \ncombinations of costs and preferences. Other models\u2014such as breakeven analysis \n(discussed in Appendix A) can help to select a facility and to choose equipment. \nPlant, equipment, and tooling decisions need close consultation between engineer -\ning, P/OM, and finance. These issues need to be guided and coordinated with top \nmanagement.\nSupermarket and department store locations are often chosen to be at the center \nof dense population zones. A center of gravity model can be used to find the popu-\nlation center, or the sales volume center\u2014instead of the center of mass\u2014which an \nengineer finds for structures or ships. Columbus, Ohio, is a popular distribution \ncenter because a circle around it within a 600-mile radius encloses a large percent -\nage of U.S. retail sales. 61% of the U.S. population and 63% of U.S. manufacturing \nfacilities lie within 600 miles of Columbus. Such a large market cannot be reached \nfrom any other state (www.conway.com/oh/distribution/ohiobody.htm).\nPlant layout models for flow shops require detailed engineering in cooperation \nwith P/OM process requirements. The technical aspects of the process are vital in \ndetermining layout for a flow shop. Layout for the job shop may be one of the few \nareas where P/OM is expected to do the job on its own. In actuality, good layout \ndecisions may be based more on models that assist visualization than on models \nthat measure layout-flow parameters. For example, computer-aided design software \nprovides detailed 3D models or 2D drawings of floor plans.\nNevertheless, there is a need to know that there are layout models for minimiz-\ning material transport distances. This is the measured path that work in process \nmust travel in the plant. These models are interesting for special applications, as \nwell as for their quantitative properties.\nHow models are used is what counts. Some applications can be criticized as miss-\ning the complex issues. The study of P/OM provides the basis for exercising good \njudgment about choosing models and methods. Layout goals now encourage commu-\nnication and teamwork instead of imitating the separate functions of a machine shop. \nLayout analysis must be based on good interactions between all interested parties.\n10.4 Location Decisions\u2014Qualitative Factors\nBest location is related to the function of the facility and the characteristics of its \nproducts and services. Also, location decisions always are made relative to what \nother alternatives exist\u2014just as building decisions are made relative to what else is \navailable. When the building and location decision is taken jointly, it is possible to \ndecide to wait for another alternative to appear. For example, the decision to consider",

This means that the lead diameter could be as wide \nas 0.55 mm and as thin as 0.45 mm. In comparison, if the stated tolerance limit \nallowed a range of 0.51\u20130.49, that range would be much tighter and more costly \nto achieve.\nFigure 8.3 illustrates the exponential increase in costs as the accepted tolerance \nrange is tightened and approaches the technological limits of the process. When \nthe tolerance range becomes tighter (i.e., 0.005 is tighter than 0.05), the cost of \ngetting all of the units produced to fall within that range becomes greater. When \ndesigners narrow the defined acceptable range, then existing equipment may not \nbe able to do the job. A greater percentage of output will not conform to the new \nstandard. Everything that falls outside the tolerance range limit is called defective. \nThese defectives must either be scrapped or reworked. Both are considered part of \nthe cost of failure.\n8.4.2 The Cost of Appraisal (Inspection)\nWhen product is examined to see whether it conforms to the agreed-upon stan -\ndards, it is undergoing inspection and appraisal. Both terms are used interchange -\nably and have to do with the evaluation of whether or not the product conforms to \nthe standards. It should, however, be understood that inspection and quality con -\ntrol (QC) are not synonymous. Inspection is one of the steps in quality assurance. \nProduct that is not judged to conform because it fails to fall within the tolerance \nlimits is sorted out. There must be a policy regarding what to do with product that \ndoes not conform, for each way that it may not meet specifications. Some types of \ndefectives have to be scrapped; others can be reworked and sold for a discount.\nThe usual way to sort out the items that do not fall within the tolerance limits \nis to inspect all of the items. However, it is possible to use acceptance sampling (AS) \nmethods, which, as the name indicates, consist of inspecting a sample of the pro -\nduction lot (see Section 8.11 on AS for details). If the sample fails to pass, then the \nentire lot is inspected and detailed. Detailing means removing the defectives so that \neach item in the lot conforms to the specifications. Therefore, when detailing, the \ninspector separates the bad from the good.\nFigure 8.4 shows the three basic costs of quality. One is the cost of prevention \nof defects (previously seen in Figure 8.2). Second is the cost of inspection, which \nincreases as the percent defective in the production lots increases. The reasons for \nthe cost increase are that more inspectors are needed and an increased amount of \ndetailing is necessary. If sampling is used, more samples of greater size will be taken \nin the same time period. All other things being equal, the increase in inspection \ncosts would be almost linear, and not too steep, as a function of increasing percent \ndefectives. The inspection cost line is shown in Figure 8.4.\nFigure 8.4 puts together Figures 8.2 and 8.3. It also shows the cost of failure, \nas discussed below, which tends to increase exponentially as the percent defectives",

It is a good idea to keep a permanent file for all location \ndecisions. In that way, pertinent history can be reconstructed and questions \nabout reengineering the decision can be explored.\n   Many location factors have to be dealt with in a qualitative fashion. \nCommon sense prevails. Qualitative factors such as being near to supplies of \nraw materials and/or sources of skilled labor vie with being close to custom -\ners. Seldom can all desires be satisfied. The options may be to choose one over \nthe other or to compromise with an in-between location.

Often, they turn to their process managers \nand appoint them to deal with the project over its lifetime. The kinds of problems \nencountered in projects are different from those encountered in the job shop and \nflow shop. Time is money in several ways.\nFirst, until the project is completed, there is seldom any return on investment. \nSecond, when projects are new products, the first into the marketplace with a qual-\nity product gets a substantial market advantage. In the same way, when the project \nfocuses on a major process improvement, there is likely to be a cost and/or quality \nadvantage that also translates into a market differential.\nThe project manager is guided by strategic planning, which is tuned to \nwindows of opportunity in the marketplace. This often means putting more \nresources to work to speed up project completion. Problems arise that slow the",

The fourth curve in Figure 8.4 \nis the total cost of quality, which is the sum of the other three curves.\n8.4.3 The Cost of Failure\nIn Figure 8.4, the cost of failure rises linearly, at first, and then accelerates as the \npercentage of defectives increases. This might reflect a replacement cost for failed \nitems that are under warranty. Then, as the percent of defectives continues to rise, \nproduct failure costs can be far more severe. Word of mouth among customers \ncauses customer defections and so the cost of lost business escalates. The curve starts \nto move up geometrically. Severe costs of failures occur when customers begin to \ndefect to competitors in large numbers as a result of serious product failures.\nThis lost revenue stream, often called the lost lifetime value (LTV) of custom -\ners, has to be taken into account as a significant cost of failure. An estimate of the \naverage LTV of a customer is an important guide for deciding how much to spend \nto prevent failures that damage customer loyalty. LTV can be a large amount of \nrevenue. For example, it can be thousands of dollars lost if a regular pizza customer \nof a particular fast-food take-out service defects to another one because of dissat -\nisfaction. It can be hundreds of thousands of dollars if a loyal luxury car customer \ndefects to another brand. Lost revenue streams are markedly significant when a \nbusiness traveler permanently shifts hotel chains.\nFurther, serious failures could involve liability of very large sums of money. The \nexpense of litigation in court trials, as well as the accompanying bad publicity, has \ncosts that are difficult to estimate.

In addition to the variables ( D, S, H, Q, and C) defined earlier, we \ndefine two more variables: p = production rate per day (daily production rate) and \nd = demand rate per day (daily demand rate). The values of p and d must be in the \nsame time unit. For example, these values could be weekly rates instead of daily \nrates. However, daily rates are most common. Q in this case is the production quan-\ntity (rather than order quantity) to be made in one lot and S is the cost of setting up \nthe machine to produce that one lot. Therefore, S is called the setup cost per set up \n(rather than order cost per order).\nLet us first study a numerical problem before deriving the equation for EPQ. \nSuppose, p = 50 units/day, d = 10 units/day, and Q = 500 (production quantity). \nThe optimal value of Q is called the EPQ. The time to produce 500 units, tp is \n10 days = 500/50, that is, tp = Q/p.\nDuring these 10 days, 50 units are produced per day and at the same time 10 \nunits (d) are used per day. Therefore, the inventory level is increasing at the finite rate \nof 40 = 50 \u2212 10 (= p\u2212 d) units per day. At the end of 10 days, the total number of \nunits in inventory will be 400 = 10 * 40. This is the maximum inventory level, Imax.\nAt the end of the 10th day, we stop producing this item and then continue to \nmeet the demand from the inventory of 400 units. The inventory will last for 40 days \n(400/10) because we have 400 units in stock and the demand rate is 10 units/day.\nThe production cycle thus consists of 50 days. For the first 10 days, we produce \nand use the item. For the next 40 days, there is no production and there is only the \nusage of the item.\nAfter 50 days, the next batch consisting of EPQ units is scheduled for produc -\ntion. This is how the cycles continue.

The examples include new production orders, customers in a bank, shoppers \nin a store, cars at a gas station, etc. The new jobs (production orders, customers, \ncars, etc.) keep on coming into the system, and the schedule needs to integrate new \narrivals every time that a new schedule is prepared which is usually whenever a job \nis completed.\n6.5.1 Example\nConsider a single-machine problem for which the data are given in Table 6.12. \nThere are five jobs A, B, C, D, and E that are waiting to be processed.

Also assume that \nthe processing time of job F is 8 days and that of G is 20 days.\nAfter job B has been processed, there are six jobs (A, C, D, E, F, and G) that are \nwaiting to be processed.

This discour -\naged people from buying trees for the holiday. In the last week before Christmas, \nthe owner had posted sale signs slashing prices. She felt that helped but nevertheless, \n25% of the trees remained unsold on Christmas eve. Five percent of them were live \ntrees that could be saved, but 20% would have to be scrapped. The seller\u2019s problem: \nhow many trees to order in July for next December? Most of the sales take place a \nfew days before Christmas. There is no time to take corrective action. What is to \nbe done if too few trees are stocked? Driving up to Canada to replenish supplies is \nimpractical. Also, there may not be any trees left there to sell. If sales are unexpect -\nedly strong, buying locally will cost too much. If too many trees are stocked, the best \nalternative is to advertise discounts, hoping to get anyone who was going to buy a \ntree to buy it from the overstocked dealer. The dealer never really knows whether the \norder size was over or under, or just right, until Christmas day. See Pasternack (1980) \nthat addresses the single-period inventory problem for donuts.\nOther static examples include the storekeeper who has to decide how many \nWall Street Journal newspapers to buy for each day. Only one decision can be made \nto buy n newspapers. In its purest form, there is no opportunity to correct that \ndecision based on later information. Another example is the problem of the hot dog \nvendor at the ballpark. Consider the department store buyer who places an order in \nJuly for toys to be sold at Christmas time. If the toy is a dud, there is severe over -\nstock. If the toy is hot, there will not be enough stock to meet demand. Both types \nof situations occur regularly. Another example is the spare-parts order for a complex \nmachine. When placed with the original order, the parts are relatively inexpensive. \nWhen required later, because of unanticipated failure, the costs are exorbitant. This \nspare-parts model is a static decision problem. In the case of overestimated demand, \nsalvage value is sometimes available. For example, a department store that overbuys \non toys, shipped from abroad in time for the holiday season, may be able to sell \nthose toys at a discount after the selling season is finished.\nDynamic situations require different considerations because the demand for such \nitems is constant. Orders are placed repetitively over time. The problem becomes one \nof adjusting inventory levels to balance the various costs so that total variable costs \nare minimized. Variable, in this case, means these costs change with order size. \nService systems use many kinds of supplies with dynamic demand patterns (as in \nhospitals, hotels, restaurants, theme parks, airlines, and educational institutions).\n5.2.2  Type of Demand Distribution\u2014Certainty, Risk, \nand\u00a0Uncertainty\nThere are decision problems that have outcomes known with certainty, for example, \nsigning a contract to supply a given number of units converts demand from a risk to \na certainty.

Determining the appropriate fixed costs to be charged to \neach job, unit made, or passenger mile flown is a joint responsibility of P/OM and \naccounting.\nDelta and American airlines also have investments in maintenance facilities, \nairport terminals, and training and education systems, as well as in their workers \nand management. The payments that airlines make to support the operations of \nairports generally are fixed and not variable costs. Airports\u2014like factories\u2014are \nmajor fixed-cost facilities; treat them as fixed costs because the same expenses must \nbe met no matter how many flights depart or arrive there. However, if part of the \nairport charges is based on the number of flights an airline makes, then both fixed \nand variable (input) costs must be considered.\n1.12.3 Outputs Associated with Revenues and Profits\nPassengers pay the airline for transportation. The number of passengers (units) that \nare transported (processed) by the airline is the output (sometimes called through -\nput to emphasize the output rate) of the system. It usually is measured by passenger \nmiles flown system wide (or between two points) in a period of time. Throughput \nis managed to balance supply (seat capacity) and demand (for seats). The demand \nlevel for transportation between any two points is related to marketing factors, not \nthe least of which is the price for a round-trip ticket.\nAll airlines do not charge the same amount for a round-trip ticket. By adjusting \nprice, airlines often can affect the percent occupancy of their flights. Such market -\ning decisions are part of the total system that affects operations. These marketing \ndecisions typify the need for systems coordination to relate P/OM with the other \nfunctional areas within the framework of the transformation model. Southwest \nAirlines (SWA) has used efficient operations to maintain low costs. This allows \nthem to charge low prices. This business model has made SWA uniquely profitable \neven though others have been trying to emulate SWA including Spirit which may \nhave even fewer frills. JetBlue, Virgin America, and EasyJet (in Europe) are among \nother \u201clow-cost airlines.\u201d\nDEPRECIATION\nDividing the total cost of an asset to reflect how much of that cost applies to \neach period of its useful life.\nFinance with P/OM\u2019s assistance must control how much overhead has to be \npaid even when no positive cash flow (revenue) is coming into the company.",

See Example 3 in \nSection 4.5.\nIn Example 1, the plant could have been designed to produce, say, 460 units per \nmonth during regular time in a single shift representing the level production of 460 \nin every period. This is appropriate for the Level plan.\nHowever, in the Chase plan, production varies from a low of 200 in period 9 to \na high of 800 in period 8. For what level of demand should the plant be designed \nif the Chase plan is being used? Suppose the plant is designed at a level of 500 \nunits per month. In that case, the plant will remain idle for some part of those \nperiods where production is less than 500; and on the other hand, if the production \nrequirements are more than 500, then overtime and/or subcontracting will have to \nbe used. The plant could even be designed to produce 800 units per month during \nregular time. In this case, the plant will remain idle for some part of all months \nexcept month 8 when the demand is 800. The plant could also be designed at 200 \nunits per month during regular time which is the lowest demand in any month. \nIn that case, overtime and/or subcontracting will be used in all months except in \nmonth 9 when the demand is 200.\nLet us do some more analysis of the mixed plan in which the production level is \n440 per month for the first 6 months, then it increases to 680 per month for the next \n2 months, and finally the production level is 380 per month for the last 4 months. \nSuppose the plant is designed for a production capacity of 480 units per month dur-\ning regular time. In this plan, for the first 6 months, we will produce 440 units every \nmonth and there will be an idle capacity of 40 (480 \u2212 440) units in each month. \nSimilarly, during the last 4 months the idle capacity will be 100 (480 \u2212 380) units \nper month since the production level is 380 per month.\nIn months 7 and 8, the production level is 680; but only 480 units can be pro -\nduced during regular time. The additional 200 units have to be obtained by work -\ning overtime and/or through subcontracting. Suppose overtime is limited to 20% \nof regular time production, meaning 96 ( = 20% of 480) units can be produced \nduring over time. So we produce 480 units during regular time per month and 96 \nunits during over time per month. However, total production should have been \n680. The remaining 104 (680 \u2212 480 \u2212 96) units will be obtained through subcon -\ntracting. The maximum number of units that can be subcontracted depends on the \navailability of appropriate suppliers.\nEach of these plans has cost implications. Various components of aggregate \nplans as discussed above include: regular time work, overtime work, subcontract -\ning, changing regular time production levels, inventories, shortages, and idle \ncapacity. Changing production level can be accomplished by changing work force \nlevels up or down. The costs of these components are added together to find the \ntotal cost of a plan. The plans are compared based on total costs to identify the \nbest plan.",

Those are statistical phe -\nnomena for which probabilities are known. Las Vegas and Atlantic City have built \ntheir gambling casino profits on the laws of probability, but customers still have to \ncome and play. Customer attendance is not a known probability. The casinos try to \nforecast attendance.\nForecasting is to foretell sales demand volume even though the probabilities \nhave never been formally studied. Business people often use their sense of what \nis happening to reach decisions that might be better made if someone had kept \na record of what had taken place already. There is often some empirical basis for \nestimating what is likely to happen in the future.\nMarketing models for predicting sales (lacking a contract) deal with levels of \nuncertainty that make forecasts of demand volumes, market shares, and revenues \ndifficult, but not irrational. One of the best sources of information about the future \nis the past. For new products, there is no past, and so other methods can be tried.\nThe focus here is on using existing data to develop forecasts. The Rivet and \nNail Factory has to forecast sales of products to develop departmental schedules \nfor the next production period. The Mail Order Company has to forecast demand \nin order to have the right number of trained agents and operators in place. Ford \nMotor Company has to forecast car sales so that dealer stocks are of reasonable size \nfor every model.\nIn every sales forecasting situation, the volatility of demand will determine how \nlikely it is that a good forecast can be made. Stable patterns that persist for a long \nperiod of time make company forecasters confident that a credible job of forecast -\ning can be done. Shaky estimates make company forecasters uneasy, so they search \nfor new factors to correlate with the demand system.\nSales patterns are becoming less stable with increasing competition and infor -\nmation. Food sales that once were stable are now affected by medical reports about \nthe food\u2019s effect on health. Auto and home sales are among many products that are \nstrongly influenced by interest rates, which fluctuate more in a global environment. \nExports and imports are sales that move around the globe in response to currency \nfluctuations that are increasingly unstable. Consequently, the best possible, eco -\nnomically feasible forecasting methods need to be used by the companies that are \naffected by increased volatility.",

BEA has become an \ninfluential model of P/OM, providing important information for capacity deci -\nsions. BEA can be done either in mathematical terms (as discussed earlier) or in a \ngraphical form as discussed in this section.

P/OM\u2019s \npotential contribution is significant in both helping to innovate new products that \nincrease revenue generation and to innovate process designs that are world-class \ncompetitively.\nThere are many theories about short, medium and long-term cycles. In the long-\nterm category, there is the Kondratiev Wave. This 45\u201360-year cycle is important \nbecause it reflects economic fundamentals of innovation (see Wikipedia for Nikolai \nKondratiev). When there is a major new invention (e.g., steam engines, internal \ncombustion engines, light bulbs, and computers) investors rush in to gain a return \non redesign for betterment and process improvements. Over five or six decades, \nreturn on investment (ROI) in aging technology diminishes in a marked way. \nImprovements become increasingly incremental. It is logical that investors search \nfor alternatives. When a promising replacement innovation appears, such as LEDs \n(light-emitting diode) instead of tungsten filament, investors\u2019 attention switches \nfrom the old marginal technology to high-return, high-risk investments in new \ntechnology. P/OM\u2019s role in guiding these major economic transitions is evident, \nwhether the cycle is named Kondratiev or something else.\nThere are many short-term cycles (e.g., the Kitchin inventory cycle of 3\u20135 years) \nthat have been proposed. They have less effect on sustainability. Long-term cycles \ntracking changeovers in technological dominance are far more significant. P/OM \ncan provide understanding of what is going on and guidance going forward. When \napplying this long-cycle concept to all economies, it is imperative to recognize that \nchange is the only constant. Those who are chosen to manage the dynamics of \nlong-term cycles (no matter how many years are involved) need to recognize the \nsustainability challenge. While particulars of any specific technological \u201cevolution\u201d \nare crucial, awareness of generic properties of long-term cycles can improve deci -\nsions about when to use innovation.\nThe third pillar of sustainability is even more ambiguous than the prior two \npillars. It is termed \u201cthe social dimension.\u201d What can P/OM do to address soci -\netal needs? From p. 174 of an article entitled Social Sustainability: One Company\u2019s \nStory, by Jesse Dillard and David Layzell, in the referenced text (Dillard, 2009), \n\u201cWe describe how one company, Intel Corporation, frames and responds to its per-\nceived social responsibilities. . . . Sustainability originates in manufacturing, has an \noperational flavor within the company, and is implemented and monitored through \ninput/output ratios.\u201d The authors conclude that Intel uses the term corporate respon-\nsibility to address various aspects of social sustainability.\nThis difficult concept of societal necessities interacts with the other two pil -\nlars of sustainability. P/OM plays a crucial role in creating well-paid, steady jobs \nthat help: raise the living standards of the world; maintain high levels of social \nhealth; contain environmental damage created by every human activity. Faced \nwith destructive forces in nature, human malevolence, and economic cycle theo -\nries, innovation by P/OMS, in coordination with others on the team, is an essential \ningredient of sustainability.",

A review of this histogram provides \nimportant information. The relative frequency for the number of times that no paint \ndefects are found is 15 out of 100 (15%). This is quite low and needs an explanation. \nIn many auto companies, the standards for paint and finish are so high that few cars \nare found faultless.

It rank orders the problems so that the most important causes can be \naddressed. The procedure to get Pareto-type information can take many forms. \nFirst, it helps us to develop a comprehensive list of all the problems that can be \nexpected to occur. To do this, many people should be consulted both inside and \noutside the company. Surveys, telephone interviews, and focus groups can be used \nto find out what problems people say they have experienced.\nComplaints are a valuable source of information. Complaints are so vital to P/OM \nmanagers that they should encourage marketing to keep Pareto data on complaints. \nThey should monitor changes in complaints both by type and frequency. Clusters \nof complaints at certain times provide important diagnostic information for process \nmanagers. Problems mentioned in the text range from power failures, to scratches or \nbubbles on an auto\u2019s finish, to complaints about restaurant service.\nSome problems arise during inspection of the product while it is on or leaving \nthe production line.

This means that bal -\nanced flow is designed for the process before it is ever run. It is expected that \nvariable costs will decrease as the fixed cost investments in equipment increase. \nContinuous process systems require a great deal of planning and investment. \nFlow shops run the gamut from crude setups arranged to run for short periods \nof times (such as days or weeks) to continuous process systems that have been \ncarefully designed and preengineered for automation. The more automated \nprocesses appeal to people who like a controlled, stable, and well-planned sys-\ntem. The lower costs of flow shop production are related to economies of scale, \nfor example, the investment in consistent process quality can be justified.\n 4. Flexible (programmable) processing systems . As far back as the 1980\u2019s, a new \nprocess category began to emerge that continues to grow faster than any other \nP/OM segment. Flexibility is derived from the combination of computers \ncontrolling machines, making this option the high-tech career choice. People \nwho enjoy working with computers prefer these technologically based envi -\nronments. There are two aspects to this attraction. First is the application of \nthe technology to do the work, and second is the programming of the com -\nputers to instruct and control the equipment that does the work. Associated \nwith the adoption of the new technology is much experimentation. Openness \nto learning is essential because the systems are continuously changing and \nneed high levels of adaptability. People who like to work with high technol -\nogy are attracted to this process configuration which is related to the achieve-\nment of mass customization (discussed in Chapter 11).\n   An assessment has found that this category continues to grow, but the \nextent of its application has narrowed. Flexibility has been stymied by design \nconstraints and higher costs than had been expected. Each product design \ndecision removes degrees of freedom for further design opportunities. The \nsecond crankshaft is easier to make than the seventh one. While progress has \nbeen slowed, there is belief that mastery of flexible technology will continue \nto be improved. Investments in flexible manufacturing systems are condi -\ntioned by the payoffs resulting from being able to increase variety without \nincurring large setup costs for each new product design made on the same \nproduction line (called economies of scope). As noted above, this is also inter-\nrelated with the achievement of mass customization. There is increasing evi -\ndence that the tipping point for mass customization is near.\nMany people prefer working with a specific type of process. There are also peo -\nple who prefer to work in either manufacturing or services; these issues usually are \nmore important than type of industry preferences. For an example of the first kind, \nautos, airplanes, and computers are associated with assembly-oriented industries. \nReal advantages often accrue to companies that hire employees from similar but \nnot the same industries.

Operations management should try to avoid supporting \nproductivity increases gained in this way; the improvement is temporary, at best. \nOther ways of obtaining lower costs such as the use of cheaper components and raw \nmaterials may lower quality.\nThe CEO had something else in mind. When requesting increased productiv -\nity, the CEO meant using technology and good P/OM methods to improve the \nprocess without lowering quality. The CEO\u2019s call for increased productivity is in \nresponse to competitive strategies.\nDecreasing quality to match lower prices is not a way to keep customers. \nImproved productivity, if it is to translate into greater customer satisfaction and \nloyalty, must come from working smarter, not harder. This means improving pro -\nductivity by means other than asking people to work faster, which usually degrades \nquality.\nThis highlights the strong functional interaction between marketing and P/OM \n(which is emphasized in Chapter 11). The managers of these areas are associates \nworking together to manage the effects of price\u2013demand elasticity on production \ncosts and on meeting quality standards. Price\u2013demand elasticity is another example \nof a crucial relationship between systems partners (marketing and P/OM) required \nfor successful strategic planning.\nElasticity is a rate-of-change measure that expresses the degree to which demand \ngrows or shrinks in response to a price change. A product with high elasticity expe-\nriences large decreases (increases) in demand as price increases (decreases), whereas \na product with low elasticity experiences small decreases (increases) in demand with \nthe same degree of price increases (decreases). Low elasticity, called inelasticity, \nmeans that demand levels are relatively insensitive to price changes. Marketing \nmanagers frequently ask market researchers to study the price elasticity of products \nor services to determine how fast demand falls off as price is increased. Products \nthat have no substitutable alternatives (as perceived by customers) usually have low \nelasticity. Product designers who strive for exceptional qualities and production \nmanagers who demand the highest feasible process qualities are creating barriers to \nsubstitutability (inelastic products).\nPerfect inelasticity\u2014when demand does not change, no matter what the \nprice\u2014is an accurate description of the situation when an industrial customer is \ndependent on one supplier for special materials. Most customers try to get out of \nsuch a constraining situation for obvious reasons.\nElasticity is a complex relationship. The rate of change between price and demand \nis not always smooth and regular. There can be kinks in the line or curve. These \noccur, for example, when an increase in price causes demand to increase, which \nmight happen when price becomes high enough to have \u201csnob appeal,\u201d which opens \na new market. Despite difficulties, it is important to measure elasticity, thereby \nrelating price and volume\u2014which are critical factors for production planning.\nThe elasticity\u2013productivity tie between operations management and marketing \nis attributed to the following:",

These considerations lead \nto the idea that we could have a \u201cMixed or Hybrid\u201d plan in which the production \nrate is kept constant at a given level for a few months and then changed to another \nlevel. This adds some stability for the benefit of the employees while producing sav-\nings on seasonal shifts in demand.\nThe production level can be changed several times during the planning horizon. \nIn the Hybrid plan proposed in this section, the production level is constant at \n23.04 units per day for the first 6 months which is the average demand for the first \n6 months (January\u2013June); then it changes to 26.35 which is the average demand \nfor the next 3 months (July, August, and September) and finally the production \nlevel changes to 20.82 which is the average demand for the last 3 months. This plan \nentails inventories, shortages, and changing production levels up and down. The \ncalculations are done in the same way as for the Level and Chase plans. This plan is \nshown in Table 4.10. The total annual cost of this plan is $1,093,359 which includes \nthe regular time labor cost ($468,480), material cost ($585,600), inventory carry -\ning cost ($17,650), shortage cost ($18,900), increasing production level ($1070), and \ndecreasing production level ($1659). Note: rounding errors can make small changes in \nthe various totals alluded to in this paragraph.\n4.4.3.4  Overtime in a Chase Plan with Level Production \nand\u00a0Overtime\nIn this plan, we show the usage of overtime for aggregate production planning. We \nuse overtime in a combination of the Level plan and the Chase plan. In the Level \nplan, the production is kept constant at a specified level. In Example 2, the Level \nplan used 23.33 as the production rate per day. It was the average production rate \nper day over the planning horizon. However, when overtime is used, we can set the \nproduction level at a lower number. For this problem, we have set the level produc-\ntion at 16.67 units per day. It could have been any other reasonable number. The \nnumber 16.67 is equal to the minimum of the production per day in 12 months. \nThe minimum production per day, 16.67, is for October (see Table 4.6).\nRegular time production in a given month is obtained by multiplying 16.67 \nby the number of days in that month. The production numbers are rounded to the \nnearest integer. The difference between the demand and production in any month \ngives the number of units that have to be produced during over time. For example, \nthe production in January is 367 (16.67 \u00d7 22) units. Therefore, overtime produc -\ntion will be 33 (400 \u2212 367). The calculations for this plan are given in Table 4.11.\nIn this plan, 4184 units are produced during regular time and 1672 units are \nproduced during overtime for a total of 5856 units. Therefore, the regular time \nproduction cost is $334,720 (4184 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 4) and the overtime cost is $200,640 \n(1672 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 4).

The reason that the parts are interchangeable is that each one falls within \nthe design tolerances. Designers are responsible for stating acceptable ranges, which \nare the design tolerances.\nMachines that could produce parts to conform to the designer\u2019s tolerances were \nthe keystone. Hand labor, better suited to custom work, began to be replaced by \nmachinery. The effects of this change hastened the Industrial Revolution. Within a \nshort time, IP was an accepted part of the production transformation process being \napplied to the manufacture of rifles, sewing machines, clocks, and other products.\nIn 1776, Adam Smith saw that the use of the division of labor as a means of \nincreasing productivity was market-volume-dependent. The pin factory that he \nstudied had sufficient production volume to warrant specialization. The production \ntransformation process was revolutionized\u2014combining worker specialization with \ninterchangeable parts transformed all of the productivity standards. Expectations \nwere raised to new levels.\n2.5.3 Scientific Management (SM)\u2014P/OM\u2019s Second Step\nFrederick Winslow Taylor (1856\u20131915) introduced scientific management, the \nnumerical measurement and analysis of the way work should be done. One of his \nlandmark studies dealt with the speed and feed rates of tools and materials for \nmetal cutting. Other studies focused on how to lay bricks and how to move iron \ncastings. Taylor\u2019s testimony at hearings concerning the setting of rational railroad \nfees for shipments in interstate commerce brought national prominence to his ana-\nlytic methodology.\nThis step in production theory added the idea that the transformation processes \ncould be improved by studying and simplifying operations. This view required ratio-\nnalizing the job, the workplace, and the workers. Strangely, it had been overlooked \nuntil the turn of the twentieth century. Finding economies of motion and putting \nmaterials near at hand were the kinds of improvements that Taylor addressed. In this \nstep, the workplace and the design of the job were enhanced to improve the produc-\ntivity of the transformation process. These industrial engineering ideas, often called \nmethods engineering, have proved to be as useful for service applications as for \nmanufacturing. They will continue to be totally relevant in the twenty-first century.\nCalled the father of \u201cscientific management,\u201d Taylor was one of the key progeni-\ntors of industrial engineering (IE). There were others as well. Associated with this \nera are Henry L. Gantt, Frank, and Lillian Gilbreth, and other pioneers who were \nattempting to develop a theory of managing workers and technology in the United \nStates. Henri Fayol was developing similar management theories in France.\nTaylor started the process of systematizing all of the elements that are part of the \nmanufacturing system. The same industrial engineering techniques developed by \nTaylor are still used by banks, insurance companies, and investment houses as well \nas by truckers, airlines, and manufacturers. They are well suited for repetitive opera-\ntions such as those that characterize fast-food chains and information processing",

For example, \nlower volumes of demand change the economics of process design. Price decreases \nmight increase demand but the lower margins will affect the quality of materials \n(and/or skills) that can be used. A spiral of decreasing loyalties can ensue with grave \nlong-term consequences for the sustainability of the system. Liability lawsuits for \ndamage, injury, and death are amplifications of lifetime value (LTV) losses. They \ncan be potential killers of a company without sufficient reserves. Such penalties are \nnot included in the normal derivation of the LTV of a loyal customer.\nInnovations may help to reinvigorate consumer demand. The analysis of LTV \nof loyal customers is valuable for managing sustainability. Loyalty will be defined as \nrepeated reuse of the goods and/or services. It does not mean that a loyal customer \npurchases one company brand exclusively. How to calculate LTV will be spelled \nout in sufficient detail to enable students of this chapter to perform such analyses. \nHow LTV and innovation interrelate will be explained.\nLTV of an angry disenfranchised customer can amount to a substantial rev -\nenue loss. For example, the average loyal pizza customer for a well-known chain \n(brand) has been shown to have a LTV revenue of about $8000 (Heskett, 1994). \nThe spreadsheet in Figure 11.4 depicts a 20-year lifetime expenditure of an aver -\nage pizza buying family summing to $10,800 (i.e., $540 per year times 20 years). \n$540 was derived from twenty-seven $20 purchases per year. The total of column B \n($10,800) is the sum of 20 payments of $540.\nThe $8,000.51 calculation of revenue, at the bottom of column D, is based \non the sum of the net present values (NPVs) of each yearly payment with a pre -\nvailing interest rate of 3.045%. NPV compares the value of a dollar in hand now \nwith the value of that dollar in the future (say a year from now). If a dollar will \nbe paid every year for 20 years, NPV will calculate the sum of those values which \nwill be less than $20.00 if the interest rates are greater than zero. The larger the \ninterest rates, the smaller the sum will be\u2014because delayed payments represent \nmoney which cannot be invested until the payment is received. Thus, the NPV \nof $1.00 paid at the end of one year (rather than at the beginning) is $0.97 with a \n3% interest rate. All payments in Figure 11.4 are at the end of year with the inter -\nest rate of 3.045%. Figure 11.4 is an Excel spreadsheet with Column C based on \nfx = NPV(0.03045,A1) = $524.04 for cell C2, fx = NPV(0.03045,A1,A2) = 1032.6 \nfor cell C3, etc. For Column D, Dn = Cn \u2212 Cn\u22121.\nThe discounted amounts become progressively smaller as payment is delayed \nanother year into the future. For example, payment value at the end of the 20th \nyear ($296.38) is 55% (actually 54.885%) of the fixed yearly payments of $540. \nNote that the value of $540 paid at the end of the first year is $524.04. Column \nC lists the cumulative discounted value of the payments in column D\u2014year by \nyear\u2014which explains why the cumulative value in the 20th year equals the total \nof column D.\nTo catch the gist of what NPV accomplishes, let us pose the question\u2014how much \nis an IOU (from the pronunciation of I owe you) worth that is dated January 1, 2015",

The most  common \nreliability parameter is mean time between failure (MTBF), which can \nalso be specified as the failure rate or the number of failures during a given \nperiod. These parameters are very useful for systems that are operated on a \nregular basis, such as most vehicles, machinery, and electronic equipment. \nReliability increases as the MTBF increases. The MTBF is usually speci -\nfied in hours, but can also be used with other units of measurement such \nas miles or cycles.\nIn other cases, reliability is specified as the probability of mission \nsuccess. For example, reliability of a scheduled aircraft flight can be \nspecified as a dimensionless probability or a percentage.\nA special case of mission success is the single-shot device or system. \nThese are devices or systems that remain relatively dormant and operate \nonly once. Examples include automobile airbags, thermal batteries, and \nmissiles. Single-shot reliability is specified as a probability of success, or is \nsubsumed into a related parameter. Single-shot missile reliability may be \nincorporated into a requirement for the probability of hit.\nFor such systems, the probability of failure on demand (PFD) is the reli-\nability measure. This PFD is derived from failure rate and mission time \nfor nonrepairable systems. For repairable systems, it is obtained from \nfailure rate and mean time to recovery (MTTR) and test \n \ninterval. This \nmeasure may not be unique for a given system, as the measure depends on \nthe kind of demand.

In all cases, reli -\nability parameters are specified with appropriate statistical confidence \nintervals.\nr\neliability \nm\nodeling\nReliability modeling is the process of predicting or understanding the \n \nreliability of a component or system. Two separate fields of investigation \nare common: the physics of failure approach uses an understanding of \nthe failure mechanisms involved, such as crack propagation or chemical \n \ncorrosion; and the parts stress modeling approach is an empirical method \nfor prediction based on counting the number and type of components of \nthe system, and the stress they undergo during operation.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

In this section, we study \nthe business value that an RFID system provides and the issues in adoption and \nimplementation of RFID.\n9.9.3.1  Business Value of RFID\nThe business value of RFID comes primarily from the visibility it provides to man-\nagers about the items tracked. RFID also provides the visibility across partners in a \nsupply chain and has an impact on reducing information asymmetries.\nDutta et al. (2007) identify the following three stages in the evolution of RFID \nbusiness value: technology deployment and integration, integration with business \nprocesses, and development of new business architectures for employees, poli -\ncies, and organizational structures. They propose three dimensions for an RFID \nvalue proposition that include RFID technology, the quantification of the RFID \nbusiness value, and the incentives for RFID adoption and implementation. The \nbusiness value of RFID emanates from labor cost savings, shrinkage reduction, \nand inventory visibility. According to Lee and Ozer (2007), the estimates of the \nvalue of RFID due to labor cost savings are relatively more reliable when compared \nto other claims because they are derived from detailed time-and-motion studies. \nHowever, the estimates of the value of RFID resulting from inventory savings, \nshrinkage reduction, out-of-stock reduction, and/or sales increases lack academic \nrigor because these estimates are invariably based on the unreliable guesses of tech -\nnology consultants and vendors.\nAmini et al. (2007) and Delen et al. (2007) analyze the business value of RFID \nin two different industrial contexts. Amini et al. (2007) used RFID to track trauma \npatients in a hospital and used the data collected in a simulation model. RFID \nimproved the tracking of patients\u2019 time from about 25% to 80% in the trauma \ncenter where patients spent about 10\u201312 h for their treatment. RFID technology\u2019s \nability to collect data in a passive manner avoids interference with medical proce -\ndures. RFID-based simulation models help in analyzing healthcare processes more \nthoroughly based on the data collected for process cycle time, patient throughput \nrate, and equipment and personnel utilization.\nDelen et al. (2007) establish the business value of RFID for a retailer by analyz-\ning the movement of RFID-tagged cases between distribution centers and retail \nstores. The analysis provides insights about the distribution of lead times among \ndifferent products and different combinations of distribution centers and retail \nstores. The RFID-generated information also helps in tracking recalls, delivering \nproducts to the stores as per schedule, and in studying the backroom process that \ninvolves moving the products to the sales floor. In addition to providing immediate \nvisibility, RFID data utilization leads to gains due to limited process changes first \nand then to the major modifications in the logistics system.",

In some \ncompanies, employees receive assessments from their manager, peers, sub-\nordinates, and customers while also performing a self-assessment.\nThe most popular methods that are being used as performance appraisal \nprocesses are as follows:\n \n1.\n \nManagement by objectives (MBO)\n \n2.\n \nBehavioral Observation Scale (BOS)\n \n3.\n \nBehaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS)\nTrait-based systems, which rely on factors such as integrity and consci -\nentiousness, are also commonly used by businesses. The scientific litera -\nture on the subject provides evidence that assessing employees on factors \nsuch as these should be avoided. The reasons for this are twofold:\n \n1.\n \nBecause trait-based systems are by definition based on personality \ntraits, they make it difficult for a manager to provide feedback that can \ncause positive change in employee performance. This is caused by the \nfact that personality dimensions are for the most part static, and while \nan employee can change a specific behavior, he cannot change his per-\nsonality. For example, a person who lacks integrity may stop lying to \na manager because she has been caught, but she still has low integrity \nand is likely to lie again when the threat of being caught is gone.\n \n2.\n \nTrait-based systems, because they are vague, are more easily influenced \nby office politics, causing them to be less reliable as a source of infor-\nmation on an employee\u2019s true performance. The vagueness of these \ninstruments allows managers to fill them out based on who they want \nto give a raise to, or feel should get a raise, rather than basing scores \non specific behaviors that employees should or should not be engag-\ning in. These systems are also more likely to leave a company open to \ndiscrimination claims because a manager can make biased decisions \nwithout having to back them up with specific behavioral information.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

For example, in January, 513 is \nused for the number of units produced whereas 23.33 \u00d7 22 = 513.26.\nHowever, the demand in January is only 400 units. Therefore, 113 (513 \u2212 400) \nunits go into inventory. In February, 467 (23.33 \u00d7 20) units are produced, whereas \nthe expected demand is for 440 units. Therefore, 27 units (467 \u2212 440) are added \nto inventory and the inventory level at the end of February is 140. In March, the \nproduction is 513 (23.33 \u00d7 22) which is 87 units less than the demand (600 units). \nTherefore, 87 units are withdrawn from inventory to meet the demand for March. \nThe inventory level at the end of March becomes 53. In this way, the calculations \ncontinue.\nIn some months, the production is less than the demand and there are not \nenough units in inventory to meet the demand. In such situations, shortages occur. \nFor example, in July we produce 117 units less than the demand (443 \u2212 560). Only \n37 units are available in inventory at the end of June. These 37 units are used to off-\nset the shortage of July. However, there still will be a shortage of 80 (117 \u2212 37) units. \nIn August, the shortage increases to 217, then decreases to 154 units in September, \nand then decreases to 14 units in October. At the end of November, there are 73 \nunits in inventory. Finally, we see zero inventories at the end of December. Total",

They assist in assessing how well the strategic \nplans are faring. Strategies can be tweaked or changed significantly if they are not \ndelivering according to plans. T and DOI measures can be useful in evaluating a \nsystem\u2019s performance under stressful conditions. In hard times, keeping inventories \nlow is critical to cash-flow control. Insufficient cash flow can jeopardize the survival \nof the firm. Airline strategies with respect to materials management (e.g., cost of \nmeals served, fuel consumed per passenger mile, airport servicing costs, etc.) were \nreevaluated after the bankruptcies of several major carriers. The main classes of \nmaterials that have to be purchased and managed in the acquisition chain include \nraw materials, component parts, and subassemblies. However, even the finished \nproduct can be procured as part of the overall make or buy strategy of a company. \nFor example, food on board is catered; it must only be unpacked and heated before \nserving to passengers.\nWe have explored materials management in great depth in Chapter 5. Therefore, \nwe will focus on the purchase activities in the following sections. The purchasing \nfunction is primarily concerned with managing vendors and suppliers.\nThe distinction between vendors and suppliers is a matter of local usage. One \nor the other and often both terms are used by various companies and/or industries \nin different regions of the United States and the world. The terminology describ -\ning outsourcing has been fragmented to describe off-shore, near-shore, best-shore, \non-shore, and even all-shore sourcing. Canada has been called a secure near-shore \nlocation for US companies. The taxonomy of names for various types of external \nsupplier relationships will continue to reflect economic and political issues such as \nthe relative costs of labor, transportation costs, and the difficulty of getting a green \ncard to enter the United States.\nAcquisition chain management (ACM) connects the external sourcing of \nsupplies to the internal scheduling of product to be delivered to the customer. \nMismanage any part of the interlinked system and the adage that \u201ca chain is as \nstrong as its weakest link\u201d applies. The internal MM system requires control of \nproduction materials, which are process flows. Further, there is control of work in \nprocess (WIP) on the plant floor and finished goods in the warehouse.\nSome companies have external control over shipments of finished goods to \ndistributors and customers as part of MM. Other companies limit MM to the \nregulation and use of incoming stock. The materials management system must be \nsynchronized and coordinated in order to be effective. The key to synchronization \nis in knowing \u201cwhen\u201d materials are needed and \u201cwhere.\u201d Coordination results in \nmeeting the deadlines. It is worth noting in Figure 9.3 how many functions must \nbe coordinated. Each deals with different aspects of materials management as part \nof the internal supply chain of the company. The incoming logistics system of the \ncompany is the outgoing logistics system of the supplier. Logistics, which are the \ntactics of materials management and product distribution, should always be in har-\nmony with the company\u2019s strategies.",

In this project, \nactivity J is the last activity. Activity J can be completed earliest at time 40 as dis -\ncussed above and shown in Figure 7.2. Let us set the due date for completion of \nthe project as 40. It could have been a different due date. A different due date will \ngenerally be greater than the calculated project due date (40 in this case). A smaller \ndue date can also be specified in which case durations of some of the activity have \nto be reduced (see Section 7.11 on crashing activities). Therefore, the LF time of \nactivity J is 40. The LS time of an activity is calculated by using\n LS time = LF time \u2212 Activity time.\nFor activity J, the LS time is, therefore, 40 \u2212 10 = 30. Next, we need to fix the \nLF times of all activities that precede activity J. Only activity I precedes activity J. \nTherefore, the LF time of activity I is equal to 30. Using the equation given above, \nthe LS time of activity I is 26 ( = 30 \u2212 4). Activities F, G, and H precede activity I. \nTherefore, the LF times of F, G, and H are set equal to 26. An explanation of fixing \nthese LF times is in order. Activity I must start latest by time 26 for the project to \nbe completed in time. For I to start at 26, all its immediate predecessor must have \nbeen completed by 26. Using the equation, we calculate the LS times of F, G, and \nH as 20 ( = 26 \u2212 6), 15 (= 26 \u2212 11), and 21 (= 26 \u2212 5), respectively. Similarly, the \nLF times of D and E are 21. Note that D and E are the immediate predecessors of \nH. The LS time of D is 9 (= 21 \u2212 12) and that of E is 13 (= 21 \u2212 8). The LF time of \nC is 15 which is the LS time of G, and the LF time of A is 9 which is equal to the \nLS time of D. The LS time of A is 0 (= 9 \u2212 9) and the LS time of C is 8 (= 15 \u2212 7). \nThe LF time of B is 13 and it needs some explanation. It may be noted that activi -\nties E and F are the immediate followers of activity B. E and F cannot start unless \nB has been finished. E must start latest by time 13 and F must start latest by time \n20 as discussed earlier. Therefore, B must finish by time 13, otherwise E cannot be \nstarted at time 13. The LS time of B is 8 ( = 13 \u2212 5). The rule to find the LF time of \nan activity when there are multiple followers is: the late finish time (LF) of that activity \nis equal to the smallest value of the latest start time (LS) of all the followers.\n7.10 Slack Time\nThe slack time of an activity is the time by which the activity can be delayed with -\nout delaying the project completion time. Slack is the allowable slippage in time. \nSlack time, by definition, can be wasted without changing project-completion \ntime. It is calculated by using one of the following equations. Both of them give \nthe same answer.\n Slack time = LS time \u2212 ES time.",

Using symbols, a forecast is to be made from some series of \nnumbers x1, x2, \u2026, xn. The numbers might be monthly sales figures for the past year. \nThe question is: What use can be made of these numbers to indicate the monthly \nsales figures for next year? How will the forecasted time series be used? Production \nschedules will be drawn up to satisfy demand. Orders will be placed for inventory to \nbe purchased. Workers will be hired and trained, or let go as the production crew is \ndownsized. Rented space will be increased or decreased, or it will stay the same. Many \ndecisions that are interrelated require believable forecasts before they can be made.\nTime-series analysis uses statistical methods, including trend and cycle analy -\nses, to predict future values based on the history of sales or whatever the time \nseries describes. In the following sections, we will discuss moving average (MA), \nweighted moving average (WMA), exponential smoothing (ES), and trend analysis \nmethods for forecasting and extrapolation.

Deming, as an American statisti -\ncian, advised Japanese manufacturers about various principles of quality including \nhis work with Dr Shewhart on SPC. The Japanese felt that Deming\u2019s influence was \nso great that they named the prize for him.\nThe companies that compete for this award include both manufacturing and \nservice industries. For example, Takenaka Komuten, an architectural and construc-\ntion firm, in Japan won the Deming Prize in1979 and Florida Power and Light \n(FPL) in the USA won the award in 1989.\n8.13.1 The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award\nDuring the 1980s, US companies felt the power that Japanese competitors exer -\ncised because of their devotion to quality. A variety of government initiatives were \nundertaken in the USA to spur improvement of the quality of American products. \nThe Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award was conceived as a program to \npromote competitiveness based on high standards of quality management among \nUS companies. There is a special small business category; the other two categories \nare manufacturers and service companies. Only companies located in the USA can \ncompete for this award.\nSummary\nThe reason that better quality is strategically important is explained.

Productivity mea -\nsures the performance of the organization\u2019s processes for doing work. Productivity \nis defined as the ratio measure of output (O) divided by input (I). Operations \nmanagement views the measurement of productivity as essential for assessing the \nperformance of an organization\u2019s productive capacity over a specific time period \nand in comparison to the competition. When outputs are high and inputs are \nlow, the system is said to be efficient and productive, but everything is relative or \nshould we say competitive?\nProductivity is relatively easy to measure for physical goods. It is more difficult \nto find appropriate measures for some services outputs such as units of education",

Important P/OM terms are explained in the text along \nwith their definitions.\nThe OM language describes methods, tools, procedures, goals, and concepts \nthat relate to the management of people, materials, facilities, energy, information, \nand technology. Operations managers learn how to study a process by observing it \nand mapping its flow; from that platform, its performance can be improved. OM \nallows for the state of a production process to be assessed. P/OM often starts from \nscratch with a new product line. In that case, what is known from prior experiences \nmust be brought to bear.\n1.4 Use of Models by P/OM\nThe Greyhound bus driver is an operations manager assessing highway-driving con-\nditions. The driver knows how rain slows velocity ( v), which cuts down miles that \ncan be driven per day ( m). The manager in charge of operating the fleet of buses \ncould describe this relationship as follows: m = vt, where m is the driver\u2019s output \nin miles driven per 8-hour day, v is the velocity, measured in miles per hour, and \nt = 8 hours. If v is 50 mph in clear conditions and 30 mph when it rains, then the \ndriver can achieve only 240 miles when it rains. The strategy of making up the 160-\nmile difference must be clear to the driver in planning stops and achieving the bus\u2019 \nfinal destination.\nThis method of quantitative description is often used by P/OM to build a \nmodel\u2014a representation of the real situation. The model permits P/OM to test the \neffect of different t\u2019s and v\u2019s. A general quantitative model that describes output is \nO = pt, where O is the output per day. O changes as a function of the production \nrate per hour (p) and the hours worked (t). P/OM develops models to describe pro-\nductivity (p) as a function of scheduling, training, technology, and capacity.\nThere are various P/OM models used to make equipment selection, workforce \nand production scheduling, quality control, inventory, distribution, plant loca -\ntion, output capacity, maintenance, and transportation decisions, among others. \nDecision models organize the elements of a problem into actions that can be taken, \nforecasts of things that can happen that will affect the results, and thereby, the rela-\ntive likelihood of the various outcomes occurring. Thus, decision models organize \nall of the vital elements in a systematic way.\n1.5 The Systems Approach\nThere are only two approaches that P/OM can use:\n 1. The functional field approach, and\n 2. The systems approach.",

P/OM is \nresponsible for understanding the total structure of blood testing.\n4.5.2 Production Capacity\nThe quality of a production plan depends on proper use of the production capacity \nof the plant, or in this case, the blood-testing capabilities of the laboratory. The pro-\nduction capacity includes the number of working days in each month, the number of \noperating shifts, the number of workers, amount of overtime allowed, and the maxi-\nmum number of units that can be bought through subcontracting (outsourcing). \nThis laboratory might operate in a single shift or in two shifts; some laboratories \nwork three shifts because expensive equipment justifies higher labor costs.\nIn Example 3, we employ a single shift without overtime. Regular production \ncapacity is the number of units that can be produced in a single shift during regular \ntime by a given number of workers. Especially in job shops, such as the blood-\ntesting laboratory, adjustments to the production capacity are made by changing \nthe number of workers.\nThe production time per testing unit is assumed to be 4 h and each technician \nworks for 8 h per day. We want to point out that in blood testing there is a need \nto check and double check every test procedure used. For example, there are two \nTable 4.14 Cost Data for Blood Testing Using Aggregate Production \nPlanning\nThe backorder cost arises because the laboratory is not able to \nprovide the blood test on time in the given month.

It may be useful to use Google to search for these \nterms. That will provide further clarification.\nA large number of new product projects fail. The percent is significant even if \nelusive. A fair average of various reports might be about 70%. That is a lot of money \nlost and energy expended without a return. The opportunity costs (i.e., lost oppor -\ntunities to be successful) are staggering. A great deal can be done to improve this \nrecord. As a beginning, all innovative organizations should learn how to be suc -\ncessful. In this regard, it is important to maintain a history of success and failures. \nMemory must be retained to promote learning. Who are the successful innovators? \nWhat methods did they use? Conversely, who and what caused failures? A success -\nful innovator in one area often fails miserably in another domain. Data analyt -\nics can be fruitfully applied to an organization\u2019s innovation record. The feedbacks \nfrom forecasts to the design team are critical.\n11.2.2 Innovation Is Essential for Sustainability\nManaging world systems (controlling changes on a global scale) is a huge problem \nthat is now called \u201cachievement of sustainability.\u201d This refers to many facets of \nglobal dynamics, one of the most important of which is protecting the environment  \nfrom critical disruptions (let us call it the first of three pillars). The climate has \nnever been steady; it has always been in flux. Mark Twain said \u201cclimate is what we \nexpect, weather is what we get.\u201d That idea still holds true. Weather is more fickle \nthan climate.\nThe critical issue is whether the changes that are now being experienced are \ncaused by people (e.g., increasing the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). If \nthe causes are natural (such as activity levels of the sun, or planetary orbits) then \nour efforts must be to adapt to (the extreme) situations that are likely to occur. In \nother words, when actions are taken by governments to control variables that have \nnothing to do with impending nature-caused catastrophes\u2014such actions mislead \npeople to believe they have controlled the situation. In fact, they have taken their \neye off-the-ball. They are addressing the wrong situation. A basic P/OM rule is that \none must adapt to inevitables. See Figure 11.1 where, along the top branch, plan -\nning for the inevitable is one of five options that must be addressed. Planning for \nthe improbable takes a lot of courage and often pays off well. It takes a Walt Disney \nto strive for the impossible.\nSustainability is a very difficult concept because it involves defining \u201csatisfac -\ntory conditions that should be maintained\u201d and defining changes that are \u201cnot \nacceptable.\u201d Although this subject does involve philosophical issues, P/OM is not \ninclined to philosophy. Instead, as the process-master it requires standards and \nmethods to measure deviations from acceptable levels. For example, P/OM knows \nwhat controls regulate CO2 emissions and it can determine how much it will cost to \nmeet a new standard, and if that is feasible. Thereby, the environment (pillar 1) and \nthe economic factors (pillar 2) become interdependent.",

The drivers of AP are forecasted customer demand, specific customer orders, \nor the workload determined through any other rigorous planning process.\nThe forecasts and workloads are translated into operational plans. The goal is to \nbe prepared to make the products and deliver them when needed. The same applies \nto delivering services to the customers at the right time. Aggregate plans outline the \nstrategies to meet the fluctuating demand for products and services for a planning \nhorizon spanning over 6\u201318 months. These are called medium-term plans. These \nplans are made after the demand forecasts are known for all periods covered by the \nplanning horizon. The plans are developed for the total demand (total of demands \nfor all products) and not separately for the demands for individual products\u2014giv -\ning it the name \u201caggregate planning.\u201d As an example, three oranges, two bananas, \nfive apples, and seven grapes are in the aggregate 17 pieces of fruit.\nAggregate plans specify the schedule of work, that is, the number of units to \nbe produced or services to be provided in every period. The plans also specify the \nresource requirements. The investment in machines and other long-term facilities \nbound the production levels and generally do not change during the planning hori-\nzon. The resources that can be altered and changed include permanent full-time \nworkers, temporary workers, and part-time workers. The plans are revised after \nperiodic intervals\u2014most frequently every quarter. The planning period, \u201cthe time \nbucket,\u201d is generally a month but any time bucket can be used. We are going to use \n\u201cmonth\u201d as the planning time bucket in this chapter.\nAP starts a chain reaction in the supply chain of suppliers\u2013producers\u2013cus -\ntomers. After the internal assignments that relate to the factory and the office are \nscheduled, the external flows begin to function. These are flows of materials from \nthe factory to the warehouses by trucks and other transport systems, which must \nbe coordinated. Transport from the warehouses to the customers must be orga -\nnized. External flows from suppliers to the production transformation system must \nbe activated. Equipment may have to be rented or bought and people hired and \ntrained, or workforce reductions may be initiated. Material flows inside the com -\npany can be scheduled in detail for specific items or in categories of specific items \nthat have been aggregated.\nBefore trying to do detailed, tactical scheduling (discussed in Chapter 6), AP \n(which is generic) should be used to avoid costly mistakes arising from not being \nprepared with the proper resources at the right time. It is important to note that AP \nis an internal production management function that leads to detailed internal pro -\nduction scheduling in later stages. We will illustrate the nature of the AP problem \nand the strategies for solving the problem through the following three examples.\n4.3 Example 1: Aggregate Production Planning\nConsider the case of a company that is manufacturing a single product to under -\nstand the nature of the problem.

Many different models of cars, refrigerators, computers, vac-\nuum cleaners, washer/dryers, etc., are built on the same production line. They are \ndifferentiated by the particular modules selected for assembly. Modularity in certain \nindustries (such as construction and computers) has improved delivery dates, increased \nvariety of choice, enhanced product quality, and lowered the cost of goods sold.\nModularity is not limited to physical products. There is process modularity \nwhich allows several models of automobiles (e.g., two-door and four-door) to be \nassembled on the same line with minimal changeover disruption. New PPP can \ntake many forms including service modularity. For example, in a restaurant, the \nwaiter takes the order and delivers the bill while the food is delivered by other \nmembers of the serving team. In the supply chain, vendors can deliver one unit \njust-in-time, or several units to a kanban system that will alert the vendor when the \nnext order must be shipped to prevent out-of-stocks occurring. These are samples of \na multitude of service innovations using the power of modularity (Baldwin, 2000).\nOpportunities for innovation are amplified greatly by the concepts of modular-\nity and platform planning\u2014where the former is one important aspect of the latter. \nMarketing has major input regarding the best ways to differentiate product, at any \ntime, and over time, by drawing on the platform potentials. However, platform per-\nmutations and component rearrangements must be coordinated with production. \nFor example, new colors added to traditional palettes are seldom a simple process \nchange, for example, going from white to grey to black may allow gradual modifi -\ncations whereas the reverse (going from dark to light) is likely to need many more \ninstances where the process must be stopped for complete take-down and clean-up. \nModularity has been around for a long time and it has succeeded greatly but disap-\npointed as well (Starr, 2010).\n11.6.4 Platform Differentiation for Different Demographics\nEvery platform has special elements that address the requirements of unique demo-\ngraphic segments. Certain groups of consumers prefer vegetarian foods for a variety \nof reasons. Satisfying these customers may constitute one aspect of platform dif -\nferentiation. Operating with the same food processing plant and much of the same \nequipment, how can the needs of those who do not want vegan dietary menus be \nsatisfied? Production managers will state unequivocally that this cannot be accom -\nplished unless the total system has been carefully analyzed and designed. In all \ninstances, various sets of needs that differ by demographic segmentation can be sat-\nisfied only by a well-diversified product platform and equivalent production system.\nThe chocolate ice cream demographic segment differs from the vanilla, and \nthere is an overlap to include those who are equally happy with both flavors. Some \nlike Starbucks coffee and others say they prefer the Dunkin Donuts brew. Within a \nStarbucks store there are 100s of different drinks that can be ordered. In addition, \ncoffee drinkers and tea drinkers represent quite different demographics. Allergies \ncreate thousands of segments. Those who cannot tolerate even a whiff of peanuts",

Theories about why con -\nsumers agree or disagree about what is best abound but they explain \u201cwhat is\u201d and \nnot \u201cwhat will be.\u201d Those in the fashion field profit from style control over time and \nthe great differences existing in choice of clothes by different age demographics. \nSupermarket aisles display an abundance of detergents in colorful containers. The \npowders and liquids inside look and function (more or less) alike but the package \noptions and the marketing campaigns seem to make the difference. Coupons are \nknown to be effective for some, but other (types of ) customers prefer to pay more \nbecause they equate price and quality. Across a very broad spectrum, demographics \nplay a big role. Well-designed product platforms enable companies to attract and \nsupply customers across a great variety of boundaries.\nMarketing managers decide which demographic segments are likely to become \ncustomers. They also determine whether innovations to the product line will chase \naway customers who were formally loyal. Once this complicated analysis is com -\npleted, decisions can be made about how the product line should evolve over time. \nPlatform planning is the method used by smart manufacturers to produce profit -\nable volumes of differentiated products configured to satisfy customers (belong -\ning to unique demographic segments). If this sounds like personalized customized \nproduct (which is known as bespoke\u2014in the U.K.) it differs in only one regard. The \ncustom tailor cuts and fits one person at a time. The product platform, on the other \nhand, satisfies the needs of segments of customers as well as being able to update \nproduct design over time. P/OM participates in platform planning by developing \nprocesses that can increase variety and/or update competitive offerings. The latter is \nachieved by substitution of innovative new modules for outdated ones.\n11.6.5 Mass Customization\nHigher levels of successful innovation have evolved since the concept of prod -\nuct platforms have been accepted and integrated as a part of strategic planning. \nTechnology has created equipment that is computer-programmed to take on a vari-\nety of on-line capabilities. Computer-assisted flexibility permits production that is \ncalled mass customization. It is an exceptional ability to differentiate product as it \nis being made  instead of having all items of a given production run being as close \nto identical as statistical variation permits (i.e., mass production). As an alternative \nexplanation of mass customization, it is when the efficiency of the production line is \nnot affected by changing one or more components before each finished production \nitem rolls off the line.\nExtension of the product platform reveals the ultimate goal of new products \ntailored to the needs and desires of each customer. Mass customization is the polar \nopposite of mass production (a stream of identical items produced in minimum",

After \ncalculating the variable cost, fixed cost, and revenue, the BEP can be calculated as \ngiven by Equation A.4 (or read off the graph in Figure A.1).\nAnalysis of the Linear Breakeven Model\nFigure A.1 has been redrawn in Figure A.2 so that the y-axis becomes both profit \nand loss. This is accomplished by rotating the total cost line to be parallel with the \nx-axis. The slope of the line in Figure A.2 reflects the rate at which profit increases \nas additional units of capacity are sold. Above breakeven, it means making profit \nfaster but below breakeven it means creating losses faster. Because companies expect \nto operate above breakeven, the larger slope is preferred.\nDuring the years 2001 and 2002, there were many dot.com (Internet) firms \nthat failed. These companies could not generate revenues to get them above their \nBEPs. They spent money on facilities and equipment. Their burn rate of investors\u2019 \nmoney was too fast. Customer acquisition occurs over a long planning horizon and \nit was not fast enough to compensate for the cash drain (outflow).\nConsider the position of the BEP in Figure A.2. If it moves to the right because \nof changes in the costs and revenues, then the supply chain must operate at a higher \nlevel of capacity before it starts to make a profit. Conversely, by reducing the BEP, \nprofit can be made at lower volumes. Companies want to operate above breakeven, \nso lower BEPs are preferred.\nFigure A.3 shows two profit\u2013loss lines marked A and B, where A and B are labels \nassociated with specific (and unique) supply chain process alternatives. Alternative \nA has a lower BEP than alternative B. This makes A more desirable than B with \nProfit\nBEP\nPercent capacity or volume (V)\nLoss Profit Total profit line\nLoss\n0\nFigure A.2 The profit and loss breakeven chart.",

It is not unlikely, observe the authors, \u201cHaving manufactured an \nOEM\u2019s product in its entirety, the CM may decide to build its own brand and forge \nits own relationships with retailers and distributors\u2014including those of the OEM.\u201d\nTo avoid such a situation, the authors suggest that the OEM should note: \n\u201cDoing so requires a few things: modesty about revealing one\u2019s secrets; caution \nabout whom one consorts with; and a judicious degree of intimacy, loyalty, and \ngenerosity toward one\u2019s partners and customers. OEMs can also elude CMs\u2019 back -\nbiting tendencies by using their surplus intellectual property to enter markets \nbeyond those for their core products. Ironically, CMs\u2019 barrier-breaking abilities, \notherwise used to invade OEMs\u2019 markets, can offer OEMs access to new mar -\nkets\u2014and sometimes a way out of the dilemma.\u201d\nTo summarize this material, global sourcing requires the systems approach to \nbe efficient and effective. There are many facets to understand, some of which are \ninvolved with the specific geography and economic conditions of regions of the \nworld and individual countries.\n9.8  Distribution Chain Management\nAs discussed earlier, the distribution chain starts once an item has been manufac -\ntured. The objective is to deliver the product to the consumer at the right time and \nat minimum cost. However, Hau Lee (2004) states, \u201cEvidently, it isn\u2019t by becoming \nmore efficient that the supply chains of Wal-Mart, Dell, and Amazon have given those \ncompanies an edge over their competitors. According to my research, top-performing \nsupply chains possess three very different qualities. First, great supply chains are agile. \nThey react speedily to sudden changes in demand or supply. Second, they adapt over \ntime as market structures and strategies evolve. Third, they align the interests of all \nthe firms in the supply network so that companies optimize the chain\u2019s performance \nwhen they maximize their interests. Only supply chains that are agile, adaptable, and \naligned provide companies with sustainable competitive advantage.\u201d\nProduct characteristics are important in designing a supply chain. According \nto Fisher (1997), these characteristics include \u201cproduct life cycle, demand pre -\ndictability, product variety, and market standards for lead times and service (the \npercentage of demand filled from in-stock goods).\u201d Fisher has found that, \u201cif one \nclassifies products on the basis of their demand patterns, they fall into one of two \ncategories: they are either primarily functional or primarily innovative. And each \ncategory requires a distinctly different kind of supply chain. The root cause of the \nproblems plaguing many supply chains is a mismatch between the type of product",

There is \ngood engineering knowledge for designing flow shop processes. Usually, it is expen-\nsive to do the job well, and worth it. There is less solid knowledge about achieving \nexcellence for job process layouts and less monetary justification. Here are four \npoints to bear in mind:\n 1. Job shops and the batch production environment are subject to major changes \nin the product mix. What is optimal for one set of orders may be downright \npoor for the jobs in the shop one month later. Therefore, layouts that are \nlikely to be good for the expected range of order types are better than those \nthat are excellent for one type and not good for others.\n 2. The degree to which a few order types dominate the job shop will modify \nthe statement in point 1 and allow some product layouts to be mixed in with \nprocess layouts. It will be found that the per unit costs of operating product \nlayouts will be significantly less than the costs associated with process layouts. \nThe comparison is even more extreme if GT cells can be set up.\n 3. Flexibility is desirable, but on the other hand, it is expensive and disruptive to \nkeep moving equipment around the plant. A balance has to be found between \nthese two objectives. If the character of the batch work changes a great deal over \ntime, it is best to go for the most general form of process layout. If layout is to be \nchanged from time to time, it is essential to set up the layout system with this \ncapability in mind. Modular office layouts that are well planned have remark-\nable flexibility for making quick changes without paralyzing the workforce.\n 4. Use quantitative models with caution. Creative thinking and common sense \npay off in achieving good layouts. Precise measurements count when trying to \nsqueeze a machine into a tight spot. More questionable is the use of elaborate \nmathematical models to minimize total distance traveled or handling costs.\n10.10.4 Layout Criteria\nWhat criteria determine a satisfactory layout? Seven measures of layout effective -\nness are presented below:\nCapacity\u2014throughput rate. Goal: Maximize total output volumes and through-\nput rates.\nBalance\u2014for perfect balance, the throughput rates of consecutive operations \nare 100% aligned and synchronized.

A well-run restaurant, hospital, school, or theater exemplifies the critical \nimportance of competent synchronization.\nFor current purposes, the main example to explore is a generic business model \nwhereby operations managers make products and/or deliver services. Using the sys-\ntems approach to coordinate the business-unit team is essential to balance supply \nand demand, meet schedules, minimize costs, guarantee quality-standards fulfill -\nment, maximize productivity, and optimize the use of critical resources.\nFor fun, a more abstract example that is widely known to both children and \nadults might be useful at this point. Jigsaw puzzles strike a chord because being \nable to assemble them smartly requires a systems perspective. Vision is needed to \nrelate the interdependent elements of pieces using clues of various kinds. Puzzle \ndifficulty increases when pieces are cut to look alike and little color differentiation \nis provided. Edges are important when internal spatial characteristics send no real \nhints concerning congruent outlines.\nPuzzles become geometrically more difficult as the number of pieces increases. \nSimilarly, as a system becomes larger with more complex interactions, it becomes \nmore difficult to fathom its structure and to understand how it functions. Operations \nmanagement problems are composed of complex subsystems, which require inter-\nfunctional communications to uncover patterns that relate the subsystems to the \nwhole system.\n1.5.6  Designing the Product Line Using the \nSystems\u00a0Approach\nThe product line (goods and/or services) is the starting point of strategic thinking \nfor the firm as discussed in Chapter 11. Every factor relevant to the success of the \nproduct line must be included in deliberations among all functional managers of \nthe business. The product line is tested against marketing assumptions.\nMarket research starts with the concept and later, after prototypes are made, \ntests them in the marketplace. If services are the products, the same consider -\nations apply. Price points are conceived that should generate an expected volume of \ndemand for the chosen qualities of the products.\nIf the products test well, then P/OM designs processes for making and deliv -\nering them. Most of the time, process improvements can be suggested based on \nchanges in the design of the products. The costs of making and delivering the prod-\nucts, and the qualities of the products, are a function of materials and processes.\nThe discussion between marketing and P/OM involves finance as well. The \nkind of processes used will determine investments required by P/OM to be under -\nwritten by the financial managers. All business functions are involved in strategic \nplanning, which means that the systems approach is essential.",

Line \npositions mean responsibility for producing products or services. The term comes \nfrom working on the production line. Staff positions by definition are not on the \nproduction line, but supportive of the line. Staff positions provide information, \nguidance, and advice on topics such as cost, quality, suppliers, inventories, and \nwork schedules.

P/OM is an international endeavor. With the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT), the European Union (EU) has become a giant market \nfor goods and services as well as a new environment for manufacturing and service \noperations (see \u201cView Partnerships Through Trade\u201d at http://wwwustr.gov).\nThe Pacific Rim has come alive with manufacturing, and great new markets are \nopening up in Southeast Asia. The off-and-on again agreement to create a free trade \nzone for the Americas stretching from Alaska to Argentina (34 countries includ -\ning the United States) is yet another potential indicator of the internationalization \nof operations management. Suppliers from everywhere will be competing in the \nglobal market. A career in P/OM will involve much travel and an equally large \namount of global communication. P/OM careers will require ability to coordinate \nand synchronize systems on a global scale. The global P/OM managers will need to \nbe familiar with local culture and customs for effective management of their opera-\ntions, and being multilingual will definitely be an asset.\nIn the following list, 12 traditional career paths are provided that highlight dif -\nferences between line and staff positions. Manufacturing jobs are followed by a list \nof service professions. Both include line and staff positions. Titles only approximate \nthe progression from top through middle management to first-level management. \nFor services, there is an even greater problem to get titles that fairly represent pro -\ngression through the management hierarchy.",

The main component of these clas -\nsifications revolves around the principle of the span of control. This refers \nto the number of subordinates a manager can effectively manage. The \nnumber of people who should report directly to any one person should be \nbased upon the complexity, variety, and proximity of the work.\nIn practice, this turns out to be a ratio of 1:5 or 1:7. Therefore, every \nfive to seven workers would report to a lead person; in turn, five to seven \nleads would report to a supervisor (5 n); and so on. This would mean that \na supervisor would be able to effectively manage twenty-five workers; a \nmanager could lead 125, and a director 625 in each department or group. \nThe higher levels of management (directors and managers) should be \nspending the majority of their time organizing and planning the activi -\nties in their respective departments, while the lower levels of manage -\nment (leads and supervisors) are predominantly involved in worker \nmotivation and control. Examples of managerial-level classifications are \nas follows:\nPresident\u2022\t\nVice president\u2022\t\nDirector\u2022\t\nManager\u2022\t\nSupervisor\u2022\t\nLead\u2022\t\nProduct- or \ns\nervice-Producing \nc\nlassifications\nThe product- or service-producing categories\u2019 associated classifications \nare those activities that are related to providing product to the customer. \nThis includes transformation processes where raw material is turned \ninto \n \nfinished goods.

Producers (manu -\nfacturers or service providers) view quality as a set of standards and specifications \nthat must be met (called conformance). On the other hand, customers view quality \nas attributes that please them. Finally, there are organizational measures of quality \nthat combine the two views in various ways. These include global ISO quality stan-\ndards, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award system (see Garvin, 1991), \nthe Deming Prize, and other competitions for prizes (see Francis and Thor, 1994).\nQuality assurance starts by assessing the requirements of the customer. The \nquality goals are determined by the preferences of the customer. The product has to \nsatisfy a variety of customer types (called market segments). For example, qualities \nthat are associated with a great vacation or a restaurant of choice differ between \nmarket segments. Since September 11, 2001, safety and security have joined the list \nof qualities that cannot be taken for granted. Quality of life is a growing concern \nas world and urban populations increase, global warming heats up, and global eco -\nnomic interdependencies (such as outsourcing) become a bone of contention.\nWhile the consumer\u2019s perception of \u201cgood\u201d quality is important, the perception \nof poor or terrible quality is a calamity. Perceived quality is a critical variable in any \nbusiness assessment. If it is not included, there can be serious repercussions. When \nit comes to gaining competitive advantage, better quality has leverage with new and \nold customers. Better quality increases customer loyalty. An investment in quality \ncan be called an expense for improved customer holding. Trade-offs between the \ncost of getting new customers and the additional price paid for better quality to \nhold onto existing customers need to be evaluated. Current research indicates that \nthe cost of holding onto an existing customer is significantly lower than the cost of \nobtaining a new customer (which requires obtaining a switch from a competitive \nbrand).\nAlienating existing customers with product weaknesses and failures has a host \nof other side effects, which are undesirable. Word spreads quickly about prod -\nuct failures. There are a growing number of consumer protection publications. \nGovernment agencies pursue a number of quality factors to assure consumer pro -\ntection.

Path 1 consists of activities P\u2013Q\u2013R and Path \n2 consists of activities X\u2013Y\u2013Z. Suppose the length of Path 1 is 20 days and the \nlength of Path 2 is 18 days. Path 1 is the critical path and the project duration is \n20 days. Suppose one of the activities on Path 2 is crashed by 1 day incurring some \nadditional cost. The length of Path 2 will become 17 days but the project duration \n(20 days) remains unchanged since Path 1 is still the critical path, and the project \ncost has increased due to the crashing of an activity on Path 2. If an activity on \nPath 1 was crashed by 1 day, then the project duration will become 19 days; Path 1 \nis still critical but its length is 19 days. If Path 1 is crashed by an additional 2 days, \nthen the length of both paths will be 17 days. At this stage, activities on both paths \nmust be crashed to reduce project duration. Crashing activities on multiple paths \nis discussed later.\nLet us return to our prior example (see data in Table 7.5 and Figure 7.1). We \nwant to reduce the duration of the critical path (A\u2013D\u2013H\u2013I\u2013J). We begin by crash -\ning the activity with the minimum cost of crashing per week which is activity I \n($500 per week). The order in which activities on the critical path will be crashed \nis: I (1 week at $500 per week), activity D (4 weeks at $700 per week), activity A (3 \nweeks at $850 per week), activity H (1 week at $1000 per week), and finally activ -\nity J (2 weeks at $1500 per week). Once all activities on the critical path have been \ncrashed, the project duration cannot be reduced further.\nTable 7.6 gives the sequence of crashing various activities and the resulting \nlength of each path and the cost after crashing the activities.\nSchedule 1 is the normal schedule in which all activities are done in normal \ntime. The activity cost is $97,000 which is the sum of normal costs of all activities. \nIn Schedule 2, activity I is crashed by 1 week at a cost of $500. The activity cost \nincreases to $97,500. The critical path is still A\u2013D\u2013H\u2013I\u2013J and its length becomes \n39 weeks. It may be noted that the length of each path has reduced by 1 week since \nactivity I belongs to all the paths.\nNext, we crash activity D which has the minimum cost of crashing per week of \nall activities that belong to critical path. Activity D can be crashed by up to 4 weeks. \nCrash activities only on the critical path(s) to reduce project duration.\nIn the case of multiple critical paths, activities on all critical paths must be \ncrashed simultaneously by the same amount.",

It may be noted \nthat calculation of DLT  becomes complex if LT also varies.\nThe value of SS depends on the variability of demand and the service level that a \ncompany wants to provide. The service level is a measure of the stock-out situations \nallowed. For example, a 95% service level means that there will be no out-of-stock \nsituation 95% of the time during LT.\nAssuming that the demand follows a normal distribution, the value of SS can \nbe determined as SS = z\u03c3LT, where, \u03c3LT is the standard deviation of demand dur -\ning LT and z is a measure of the service level that we want to provide. z is called \nstandard normal random variable and can be found from its statistical table. For \nthe 95% service level, the value of z = 1.65.

The large \nbuffer stock means that the carrying cost of stock is high to make sure that the \nactual cost of stock-outages is small.\n5.10.2 Operating the Perpetual Inventory System\nThe first step to understanding how the perpetual inventory system works is by \nstudying its graphic representation. Figure 5.10 illustrates the two parts that have \nbeen put together. The EOQ model sits on top of the buffer stock (which is the \nshaded rectangle).\nFollow the stock on-hand line as it forms an irregular saw-tooth pattern. When \ndemand becomes greater, the line moves down faster, and when the demand rate \ndecreases, the line moves down more slowly. In other words, when the slope of the \nline becomes steeper, the RP ( QRP) is reached more quickly. The interval between \norders is variable depending on whether the demand has been faster or slower than \nthe average rate.\nNote in Figure 5.10, the first of the replenishment cycles stops right at the \nbuffer-stock line. At that point, SOH is zero and no buffer stock is withdrawn. \nDemand dips into the buffer-stock region only for the second replenishment cycle. \nIn other words, buffer stock is called upon once in three replenishment cycles. The \nbuffer stock withdrawn will be replaced when the next order is received and the \nunits are put in stock.\nThe third of the three replenishment cycles shows an order arriving when the \nstock level is above the buffer-stock level. If the demand distribution is stable over \ntime, then the buffer-stock level will average out to the planned number of units \nfor buffer stock.",

Information systems provide the necessary \ndata about customer needs so that operations management can supply the required \nservices.\nBoth services and manufacturing are increasingly responsive to\u2014and controlled \nby\u2014information systems. Therefore, knowledge of computers, computer program-\nming, networking, and telecommunications is essential in both the manufacturing \nand service environment. The field of analytics, which combines computer power \nwith huge amounts of data, has been growing exponentially as the comfort level \nof managers with computers analyzing big data has improved. Massive amounts of \ninformation can be stored and analyzed for the first time in the history of manage -\nment. P/OM is at the forefront of this systems-oriented evolutionary capability.\nSchools of business include both goods and services under the term operations, \nwhereas industrial engineering departments are still inclined to teach \u201cproduction\u201d \ncourses. Nevertheless, there is inevitable convergence of both to an information-\ndominated workplace.\nOperations is the familiar management term for an information systems envi -\nronment, so the word \u201coperations\u201d fits nicely.\nProgramming and maintenance (both service functions) have become increas -\ningly important to manufacturing. Further, the relevance of service to customers \nincreasingly is viewed as a part of the total package that the manufacturer must \ndeliver. Manufacturing joins such distinguished service industries as transporta -\ntion, banking, entertainment, education, and healthcare. In this regard, note the \nfollowing trends for manufacturing:\n 1. The labor component (the input of blue-collar workers) has been decreasing \nas a percent of the cost of goods at an accelerating rate for over 50 years. In \npart this explains the persistence of unemployment in the developed econo -\nmies of the world.\n 2. The technological (and capital assets) component as a percent of the cost of \ngoods has been increasing for many years. In the past 20 years, this effect has \nbecome multiplicative, with computers controlling sophisticated and costly \nequipment across vast distances via satellites and networks.\n 3. As information systems play a larger part in manufacturing, highly trained \ncomputer programmers (sometimes called gold-collar workers) and white-\ncollar supervisors add to growing sales and administrative (overhead) costs, \nwhich have to be partitioned into the cost of goods. These costs are an increas-\ning percent of the cost of goods. Traditional methods for assigning these costs",

The game simulates the situation in such a way that the players rec -\nognize the factors that are important. If the game is properly designed, it should \nlead to players improving their real-world performance. That results when players \nunderstand the drivers of outcomes and throughput.\nRetailers, distributors, and producers (manufacturers) can order too much (beer) \nor too little (beer) when information about actual demand for the brand is delayed \nalong the linkages of a supply chain. The effects of ordering too much or too little as \na result of information delays can be costly. The resulting imbalance of demand with \nexisting capacity is important to understand. The game shows how the performance \nof a linked system is tied to the adequacy of forecasts about future demand.\nThere are measures that can be taken to improve communications and reduce \ninformation delays. There are methods for improving forecasts as well (collabora -\ntive forecasting). For example, it may not be possible to improve the national esti -\nmates of demand unless they are looked at as the sum of regional demands. Once \nimprovement has been made in timeliness of information and better forecasts, the \ngame players can achieve decreased costs.\nForrester (1961) used simulation to demonstrate many of these effects in 1961 \nwith his seminal work on systems dynamics. This was at the Sloan School at MIT, \nwhere the \u201cbeer game\u201d was developed in the 1960\u2019s.\nTables in Figures 9.8 and 9.9 show the data for simulations that reflect the \neffects of delays on supply chain decisions made by producers, wholesalers, retail -\ners, suppliers, and customers. These simulations are identified with the Better Beer \nCompany whose product, called Woodstock, is at the heart of the simulation.\nBegin week 1 with 12 cases of stock on-hand (SOH). Supply at the start of \nthe week is 4 cases, so net SOH is 16 cases. The demand is for 4 cases, so end \nof week 1 SOH is 12 cases. The retailer orders four cases (see column \u201cOrder \nQuantity\u201d). Assume lead time to be 3 weeks. Therefore, the four cases will be \ndelivered at the beginning of week 5. Continue to read Figure 9.8 in this fash -\nion. Note that in weeks 10, 11, and 12, the end SOH rose to 24 cases, double \nthe normal amount.\nFigure 9.9, the next link in the supply chain, connects the producer (manu -\nfacturer) and the distributor. To read the table, follow the same procedure as with \nFigure 9.8. Thus, week 1 begins with 64 cases of beer at the distributor and end \nSOH is 64. Lead time is 4 weeks, so the order placed at the end of week 1 is received \nat the beginning of week 6.\nThese tables show how the retailer, spotting what seems like a major increase in \ndemand (from 4 in week 1 to 8 in week 2) orders substantially more stock to avoid",

For this reason, \nadministrative and supervisory costs are usually treated as fixed charges. Together \nwith purchasing and sales, they are bundled together as overhead costs. Salaries and \nbonuses paid to the CEO and to every other manager are overheads because they \ncannot be assigned to specific products and services. Additionally, insurance, facil -\nity costs, electric charges, maintenance of equipment are all fixed costs if and only \nif they are not related to how many units have been produced.\nRevenue\nWhen goods and services are sold in the marketplace, they generate revenue. This \nbreakeven model treats revenue as a linear function similar to variable costs. Each \nunit sold generates the same amount of revenue equal to the price per unit. An \nassumption of BEA is that all units made and stored are delivered and sold.\nThe BEA question is: How many units of throughput need to be sold in order to \nrecover costs and to breakeven? The results change over time as factors vary. Fixed \ncosts often grow, prices change, and variable costs per unit decrease with proper \nP/OM attention.\nA.1.1 Linear Breakeven Equations\nWe use the following symbols for BEA:\np = price per unit\nvc = variable costs per unit of production\nFC = fixed costs per period T\nV = number of units made and sold in time period T\nTVC = total variable costs = (vc)V\nTC = total costs per period T, where\n TC = FC + TVC = FC + (vc)V, (A.1)\nTR = total revenue per time period T, where\n TR = (p)V, (A.2)\nTPR = total profit per period T, where\n TPR = TR \u2212 TC = (p)V \u2212 FC \u2212 (vc)V = (p \u2212 vc)V \u2212 FC.

See Chapter 5 for a discussion of ABC classification.\nIn addition to establishing minimum standards that every supplier must meet, \ncertification is like a bidding process for long-term relationships. Companies use \nthe certification process to choose the best in the class\u2014just like they use various \ncriteria to hire students based on grades, dean\u2019s list, and personal evaluations. Most \noften, the requirements for suppliers are equivalent to the company\u2019s internal stan-\ndards for itself with respect to excellence in quality and reliability.\nThe number of suppliers chosen can vary from one to several.

Accepted suppliers are regularly reviewed to make certain that they main-\ntain their \u201cwinning\u201d status. Thus, although certification aims at long-term relation-\nships, it is subject to reassessment. Often, smart buyers raise acceptance standards \nwhile assisting certified suppliers to meet the new and more stringent standards.

In the early twentieth century, these costs were of \nlittle importance to most businesses. However, in the twenty-first century, \nthese costs are often more important than the variable cost of a product, \nand allocating them to a broad range of products can lead to bad decision \nmaking. Managers must understand fixed costs in order to make decisions \nabout products and pricing.\nThe concept of quality costs (see Table\n \n6.6) is a means to quantify the \ntotal cost of quality-related efforts and deficiencies. It was first described \nby Armand V . Feigenbaum in a 1956 Harvard Business Review article.\nPrior to its introduction, the general perception was that higher qual -\nity requires higher costs, either by buying better materials or machines, \nor by hiring more labor. Furthermore, while cost accounting had evolved \nto categorize financial transactions into revenues, expenses, and changes \nin shareholder equity, it had not attempted to categorize costs relevant \nto quality. By classifying quality-related entries from a company\u2019s general \nledger, management and quality managers can evaluate investments in \nquality based on cost improvement and profit enhancement.\nInternal failure costs : These are costs associated with nonconformities \nthat are found during receiving, in-process inspection, and finished-\ngoods inventory prior to shipping to the customer. Examples would be the \nfollowing:\nScrap\nRework\nSupplier scrap or rework\nSorting\nRetest and reinspection\nRegrading\nExternal failure costs : These are costs associated with nonconformities \nthat are found by the customer.

In this case, the material will be purchased three times during the year \nand the average inventory will be Q/2 = 400/2 = 200.\nThe annual inventory holding cost is, therefore, given as (Q/2) * H. An increase \nin the value of Q will increase the annual inventory holding cost and vice versa.\n5.4.3 Annual Item Cost\nThe annual item cost is calculated by multiplying the annual demand D by the \nitem cost C, that is, annual item cost = D * C. A change in the value of Q does not \nchange the annual item cost. It may, however, be pointed out that the annual item \ncost will change with a change in the value of Q if quantity discounts are involved. \nThe quantity discount model is discussed later in this chapter.\n5.4.4 Annual Total Cost\nThe annual total cost is given by\n \nTC D\nQ S Q HD C= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2217+ \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2217+ \u22172 .\n5.4.5 Annual Total Variable Cost\nIn the equation for TC, the values of D, H, and S are known (or can be estimated). \nThe only unknown variable is Q which is the decision variable. Therefore, the only \ncosts that are affected by changing the value of Q are the annual ordering cost and \nthe annual holding cost. The sum of these two costs is called the annual total vari -\nable cost (TVC). TVC is given by\n \nTVC D\nQ S Q H= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2217+ \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 \u22172 .\n5.4.6 Example for Cost Calculations\nSuppose D = 1200 units, S = $5.00, H = $1.20, and C = $12.00. Table 5.1 gives \nthe values of annual ordering cost, annual inventory carrying cost, and annual \nTVC for several values of Q ranging from 50 to 300. The annual item cost will \nremain constant at $14,400 (= 1200 * 12) irrespective of the value of Q. The range \n50\u2013300 is arbitrarily chosen to explain the changes in the values of these costs with \nchanges in Q. It can be seen in Table 5.1 that as Q increases from 50 to 300, the \nannual ordering cost continues to decrease and the annual inventory holding cost \ncontinues to increase. Both TVC and TC first decrease, go down to a minimum",

It was used to design and coordinate chemical plant opera -\ntions. Even at the time of development, computers were crucial.\nThe essential difference between PERT and CPM is in specifying the times for \nperforming various activities. This is primarily due to their origins and early projects \nfor which they were developed and used. PERT was used for projects where the activ-\nity times were not certain because project managers were unfamiliar with activities. \nOn the other hand, the projects and activities were familiar to the project managers \nin the case of CPM. These days the distinction between PERT and CPM seems to be \ndisappearing and together these are called PERT/CPM or simply network techniques. \nThese two methods share the notion of a critical path as discussed later in the chapter.\nBoth applications were very successful in reducing project time. Before net -\nwork methods existed, project slippage was a fact of life. Projects often took 20% \nmore time than expected and cost 20% more than budget estimates. With PERT \nand CPM, 20% reductions in expected values were experienced. The adoption of \nthe new project methods was immediate within the United States. Many different \nkinds of software were developed that could be used for very large projects includ -\ning year-end budget preparation.

Take a look at www.thebhc.org/publica -\ntions/BEHprint/v022n1/p0210-p0222.pdf.\n7.6 Project Network\nThree steps are required to utilize these network models.\n 1. Detail all of the activities that are required to complete the project.\n 2. Establish the precedence relationships among activities and document the \nrationale for these relationships so that all teammates can share this informa -\ntion. The historical record is permanent and explicit. Draw a precedence dia-\ngram (a network) for the precise sequencing to be used based on technological \nfeasibility, managerial objectives, administrative capabilities, equipment, and \nworkforce constraints.\n 3. Estimate the time to perform each task or activity. The method of estima -\ntion for activity times needs to be detailed and related to project quality. For \nexample, more time is required to use double-error checking\u2014to be sure that \nno project defects occur. Double-error checking means that two different \npeople (and/or methods) are used to verify that no errors occur.

The goal is to recover value at every \nstage of both forward and reverse supply chains. For example, design for economic \ndisassembly has received attention from all auto manufacturers for various reasons \nincluding the great number of take-back laws that presently exist and new ones that \nare coming into force every year.\nThere is a lot of waste in the supply chain. Companies that excel in managing \nclosed-loop supply chains have significantly better profit margins. There are plenty \nof examples but we will focus at this time on the automotive sector. BMW is one \nof the leaders in innovative recovery, reuse, and disposal of materials from retired \nvehicles. BMW has led in disassembly with recycling goals of better than 95% (by \nweight) of its cars.\nEventually close to 100% of all materials used in appliances, cans, cars, com -\nputers, TVs, etc. will be returned for recycling and/or disposal by the manufactur -\ners. Chrysler, Ford, and GM actively participate in the United States Council for \nAutomotive Research (USCAR) which directs research into end-of-life-of-vehicle \n(called ELV) by the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP). Ford\u2019s Global Director, \nSustainability and Vehicle Environmental Matters, and Ford\u2019s CFO explain how \nthe company is engaged in many aspects of closed-loop life cycle planning (con -\nsistent with ONE Ford plan). These issues are related to the three pillars of sus -\ntainability (see Section 11.2.2). As The Growing Strategic Importance of End-of-Life \nProduct Management states, we must predesign for efficient end-of-life reuse (Toffel, \n2003).\n11.8 Innovators and Imitators\nThe strategic success of new product planning using the planning platform to guide \ninnovation is vital for overcoming the many hurdles that exist in the marketplace. \nCompanies that are masters of innovation must be totally prepared to adjust for \nboth marketing and production surprises. What turns a novice into a master of \ninnovation? Novices are often taken by surprise because they are new to a field and \nlack experience. In today\u2019s marketplace conditions are changing so rapidly that \nit may be impossible for anyone to become a master without the means to keep \nabreast. That explains why both production and marketing rely on good market \nintelligence (viz., market research). Examples of failure to listen to the marketplace \nare legion as are cases where the company lacked versatility and flexibility. No one \ncan understand the marketplace without listening. Then, upon hearing, the versatile \norganization responds with an appropriate plan (see adaptability in Section 11.2).\nIt is widely acknowledged that good new ideas are rarely exclusive. Important \ntechnological discoveries are seldom well-kept secrets. Every technological advance \nsets the stage for new inventions to appear. These are quickly assimilated by many \nspecialists. The speed with which new technology is transferred around the globe \nreflects the growing number of individuals who are working on the same problem.",

This concept \nalerts everyone: Some materials are more important than others\u2014it is prudent to \ndo what is important before doing what is less important. This concept applies to P/\nOM in a number of different. Two are discussed here.\n5.6.1 Material Criticality\nIt is necessary for materials management to categorize the critical nature of parts, \ncomponents, and other materials. There are various definitions of \u201ccritical\u201d that fit \ndifferent situations. When a part failure causes product or process failure, it is a \ncritical part. Many parts of an airline engine may be critical, in this sense.\nThe following scenario is relevant. This airline considers parts to be most critical \nthat have greater than a 10% probability of failing within 1 year. Membership in \nthis top-ranking group is called A-critical. Perhaps the top 25% of all critical parts \ncan be classified as being A-critical.\nA second set, called B-critical, is identified by the airline as any part that has \ngreater than a 10% probability of failing within 5 years. A-critical items are excluded. \nPerhaps the next 25% of all critical parts can be considered to be B-critical.\nThe third set, called C-critical, might be associated with greater than 10% prob-\nabilities of failing after 5 years. Because 50% of the parts are in the A and B groups, \nthe remaining 50% of the parts are in the C group. The numbers can be adjusted so \nthat A, B, and C are 25%, 25%, and 50%, respectively, of the total number of parts.\nAs an alternative definition, part failure can have a probability (not a certainty) \nof stopping the process or product. Thus, a possible description of critical parts \nrelates to the probability of total process or product failure when the part fails.\nThe parts are rank ordered by the probability of causing process or product \nfailure. Say that if the first part fails, there is a 30% probability of product failure. \nThe next part might have a 20% probability. Perhaps the top 25% of critical parts \nhas an 80% probability of causing (each independently) product failure. This kind \nof situation is depicted in Figure 5.7.\nSome processes do not fail as a result of part failure but instead the production \noutput is reduced by a significant amount. Curves similar to Figure 5.7 can be cre -\nated for such situations.\nCriticality is a coined term that can mean crucial to performance or danger -\nous to use. Thus, an alternative definition of criticality could apply to the danger \ninvolved in using materials. Flammability, explosiveness, and toxicity of fumes are \ncrucial safety factors for materials management. Whichever definition of critical -\nity is used, the procedure is to list first the most critical parts. Next, systematically \nrank-order parts according to their relative criticality. The concept of criticality \nshould reflect the costs of failures, including safety dangers, loss of life, and losses \nin production output.\nSpare parts and other backup materials should be provided to conform to reme-\ndial failure strategies. Also to be considered are replacement parts for preventive",

A balanced choice has to be made, which will depend on \nthe specific product and the location of its raw materials, fabrication, and market \nplaces. Assembly plants try to keep their component suppliers close-by, and they \nencourage their suppliers to deliver on a just-in-time basis. The advantage to the \nsupplier is that enough volume of business must be given by the producer to jus -\ntify the nearby location. Similarly, for logical reasons, services usually profit by \nbeing close to the customer. Creative service solutions often depend upon reciprocal \ninteractions.\nThe decision to be a nearby just-in-time supplier requires a mutual interchange \nof trust and loyalty. Just-in-time suppliers benefit from the proximity by being a \nsingle source (or one of very few sources) to their customer. Communication can be \nface-to-face and frequent. Customers benefit from reduction of inventory. Suppliers \nbenefit from stability and continuity.\n10.4.3 Location Factors\nSix factors that can affect location decisions are:\n 1.  Process inputs . Closeness to sources is often important. The transportation \ncosts of bringing materials and components to the process from distant loca -\ntions can harm profit margins.\n 2. Process outputs . Being close to customers can provide competitive advan -\ntages. Among these are lower transport costs for shipping finished goods and \nthe ability to satisfy customers\u2019 needs and respond rapidly to competitive \n pricing\u2014which can provide market advantages.\n 3.  Process requirements . There can be needs for special resources that are not \navailable in all locations (i.e., water, energy, and labor skills).\n 4. Personal preferences . Location decision makers, including top management, \nhave personal biases for being in certain locations that can override economic \nadvantages of other alternatives.\n 5.  Governmental issues. Tax, tariff, trade, and legal factors usually matter. Trade \nagreements and country laws are increasingly important in reaching global \nlocation decisions.\n 6. Site and plant availabilities . The interaction between the location and the \navailable facilities makes location and structure-site decisions interdependent.\nShipping costs are the primary concern for the first factor, viz., process inputs. \nThese may be a function of shipping distances. However, there are more likely to be \nprice advantages for specific materials in certain regions and countries.\nFor the second factor, viz., process outputs, being close to the customer have \na variety of advantages including shipping distance for delivery and nearness for \ndirect contact to remedy complaints and to consult on product changes.

Sequencing  for both services and manufacturing is \nthe next logical procedure. It completes assignments by specifying the order in \nwhich jobs are to be done. In this chapter, we have described various sequencing \npolicies.\nScheduling decisions rarely achieve optimal assignments for every job at every \nfacility. Best assignments can seldom be made on a one-by-one basis. Instead, the \nproblem must be looked at as a whole. As an analogy, NASA found that if every \ncomponent of a space vehicle is optimized with respect to its function and only its \nfunction, the \u201cbird will not fly.\u201d Instead, the vehicle must be designed together as \na coordinated system of components.

The product does not stay in the mature stage long and has to be \nreplaced more often. More new product introductions are required to replace wan-\ning products. The challenge for P/OM is the rapidity of adjustment that is required \nto all of the life-cycle stage changes and to go through them frequently, that is, \nplant expansion and contraction, new supply chain sources, inventory obsoleted by \nimmediate demands for new products (e.g., iPhone 5).\nP/OM thinking is crucial to each of the four stages. The new design that is \nabout to enter production has been finalized. There still are many questions to be \nanswered. How much product must be made for distribution at start-up? How \nmuch product will be needed to keep the supply lines filled to meet the demand \nduring growth? How much capacity is to be used at each of the stages? How much \ntraining will the evolving work configurations require? Making or buying decisions \ncan change. What should be bought at first, at the lower volumes, might be better \nmade in the plant, at the higher volumes that are associated with maturity. The \nglobal supply chain is a dynamic factor which demands up-to-the-minute informa-\ntion and rapidly changing plans.\n3.9.4  Protection of Established (Mature) Products \n(Goods\u00a0and\u00a0Services)\nOrganizations that have been successful with their new product introductions can \nbank on having established products or services that generate cash flow. The \u201cbank\u201d \nis not as good as it used to be though, because the competitive rate of new product \nintroductions has increased markedly in recent years. P/OM requires the cash to \npay labor and buy materials from suppliers. Generally, P/OM spends more cash \nthan any other department in the company. These cash accounts for operating \nexpenses may total 70% of all cash spent by the company.\nTo meet the cash flow requirements and to have the right plans in place requires \nexcellent forecasting abilities of the marketplace dynamics. This is the phase where \nmany big companies failed to forecast changes and they lost their edge or went bank-\nrupt. Examples include, Sony\u2019s Betamax, Blockbuster, Borders, Circuit City, Digital \nEquipment, Eastman Kodak, Enron, Global Crossing, Lehman Brothers, Nortel, \nPolaroid, Pan Am, Sharper Image, Sun Microsystems, and Wang Laboratories. \nEach and every one of these situations might have been avoided if forecasting had \ncalled attention to the cliff that was in front of their fast moving trajectory.\nBecause of global organizations, there are more competitors in the game, and \nbecause there are more competitors, each organization competes harder. Increased \ncompetition has led to higher levels of market volatility. Nevertheless, for most \nproduct categories, there is still plenty of opportunity to benefit from the mature \nproduct life-cycle stage. P/OM benefits from the security of established products",

In such cases, we might choose a \nsmall value of n, even if we have to sacrifice some accuracy.\nTo find out the value of n that should be chosen we can calculate the errors \nfor different values of n and the n which gives the least error may then be chosen. \nSee more details in the section on error analysis. The value of n is specified by the \nmanager and generally remains constant until there are reasons indicating a change \nin the time-series pattern. If the underlying pattern of the time series changes the \ncurrent value of n may not give good forecast.\n3.3.2 Weighted Moving Average\nA way to make forecasts more responsive to the most recent actual occurrences \n(demand) is to use the weighted moving average (WMA) method. Just like the MA \nmethod, the most recent n period are used in forecasting. However, each period is \nassigned a weight between 0 and 1. The total of all weights adds up to 1. The highest \nweight is assigned to the most recent period and then the weights are assigned to the \nprevious periods in the descending order of magnitude.\nExample: Consider the data given in Table 3.2. Suppose the number of periods \nused in forecasting n = 3 and the weights are 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5. The highest weight \n(in this case 0.5) is assigned to the most recent period. For example, the forecast for \nperiod 4 will be calculated by using the weight 0.5 for period 3, 0.3 for period 2, \nand 0.2 for period 1. The forecast for period 4 will then be\nForecast Demand Demand Demand\nFore\n() .( ).

Our use of the term is associated with direct problem-solving rather \nthan the philosophical general systems theory (GST) that was developed by Karl \nLudwig von Bertalanffy around 1950. GST had a biological foundation but was an \ninterdisciplinary approach to the interacting components of complex systems. For \nP/OM, the systems approach is based on studying all elements related to creating \nbetter products and processes.\nOur text is permeated by such systems thinking, for example, strong interac -\ntions abound between forecasting methods (Chapter 3), capacity management and \naggregate production planning (Chapter 4), inventory management (Chapter 5), \nsupply chain management (Chapter 9), and innovation by P/OM for new product \ndevelopment and sustainability (Chapter 11). Students will not have to search for \nthem because they are delineated throughout the text.\nThis book does not hide the fact that its authors are subscribers to interdisci -\nplinary and interfunctional solutions to problems. This proclivity follows from any \nhonest application of the systems approach. For societal organizations (profit and \nnonprofit) to strive to solve problems, it is essential that all relevant disciplines team \nup, share data, and cooperate. There are no party lines here. Problem-solving needs \nto be based on optimizing organizational benefits.\nRegarding cooperation, we need to clarify the field relationships of OM (opera-\ntions management) to OR (operations research). In fact, traditional OR has now \nstrongly associated itself with a new catchy title, viz., analytics. Classic OR dates \nback to World War I when the British scientific community led by physicist Patrick \nBlackett developed quantitative models for submarine search and military logistics \n(see Stephen Budiansky\u2019s Blackett\u2019s War: The Men Who Defeated the Nazi U-Boats \nand Brought Science to the Art of Warfare). Many developments of these 1940 scien-\ntists have been absorbed in the body of P/OM practice at the present time.\nThere have always been neophytes who cannot seem to differentiate between \nOR and OM. This Preface is an ideal place to set the record straight. Operations \nresearch is quantitative modeling of decision processes. When the decisions relate \nto planning for the production of goods and services, the modeling abilities of \nOR are used by OM. However, operations management is hardly limited to math-\nematical and statistical modeling. A great deal of P/OM problem-solving is done \nby experience with what works (know-how), common sense, logical analysis, and \nclever heuristics (rules of thumb).\nAnalytics is like a flavor of OR with its emphasis on the use of \u201cbig data\u201d to \nresolve decision problems. The methods of \u201cbig data\u201d include data-mining and \npredictive analytics. The responsibility for organizing massive amounts of data \nbelongs to the information technology (IT) department. Apache\u2019s Hadoop (high-\navailability distributed object-oriented platform) is favored by many IT profes -\nsionals. Although such matters are not within P/OM\u2019s sphere of expertise, it is in",

Examples of forecasting include the \nnumber of patients in a hospital, students in a college, customers in a grocery store, \ncars to be manufactured, and so on. The demand forecasts set the agenda for how \nthe entire company will use its people, commit its resources, call on outside sup -\npliers, and plan its work schedules. Forecasts provide information to coordinate \ndemands for products and services with supplies of resources that are required to \nmeet the demands. As such, the forecast is the platform for future planning. This is \nreactive planning. A good strategy also aims at modifying the forecast to influence \nwhat the future might bring rather than just accepting the forecast as an inevitable \ntruth. In this way, management earns its rewards by better fitting production capa-\nbilities (short and long term) to marketing possibilities. This is proactive planning.\nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to:\n \u25fe Describe the importance of forecasting.\n \u25fe Explain various components of a time series.\n \u25fe Choose an appropriate forecasting model.\n \u25fe Perform regression analysis.",

Adding ingredients to prevent spoilage increases material and \nproduction costs while decreasing the carrying cost for product deterioration. \nThe net market effect must be factored in as well. Spoiled milk and stale bread \nare quickly perceived, but customers can avoid buying products before they \nspoil by noting freshness dating information as required for milk and bread. \nWhatever cannot be sold because of real or dated deterioration is added to the \ncarrying cost. Some drugs like aspirin are dated. Although drugs are vulnerable \nto spoilage, many people use them anyway because though ineffective they do \nnot taste bad.\nSome products that are not required to use freshness dating are testing its \neffect on their market share. Consumer advocacy groups are suggesting regulations \nthat automobile tires be dated because there is age deterioration in tire materi -\nals. Freshness dating not only increases the carrying cost component, but it also \nincreases demands on operations to make and deliver product as much before the \nfreshness date as possible. Delays in getting dated products to market will decrease \nrevenues, productivity, and increase carrying costs. It is evident that consumers \nwant many product categories to show elapsed time. Freshness dating increases \nproduction and inventory costs.\nAn added component of carrying cost is both taxes and insurance. If insurance \nrates and taxes are determined on a per unit basis, then the amount of inventory \nthat is stocked will determine directly the insurance and tax components of the \ncarrying costs.\n5.3.4 Costs of Discounts\nAccepting discounts by buying at least a certain amount of material involves extra \ncosts that may make taking the discount unprofitable. An appropriate inventory \ncost analysis must be used to determine whether a discount that is offered should be \ntaken. The extra costs for taking the discount are compared to the savings obtained \nfrom the discount. Extra expenses include additional carrying costs. Part of these \ncarrying costs is incurred for additional storage space.\n5.3.5 Out-of-Stock Costs\nWhen the firm does not have stock to fill an order, there is a penalty to be paid. \nPerhaps the customer goes elsewhere, but will return for the next purchase. Then \nthe penalty is only the value of the order that is lost. If the customer is irritated \nby the out-of-stock situation and finds a new supplier, the customer may be lost \nforever. The loss of goodwill must be translated into a cost that is equivalent to the \ntermination of the revenue generation of that customer. The specific cost is how",

These are generally extracted from the ground \nand then refined, but they are still the basic ingredients. Examples include mined \nmetals such as copper, gold, and platinum; chemicals such as sodium and potas -\nsium salts, manganese, and phosphates; grains such as wheat and rye; beans such as \ncoffee; natural gas, and petroleum.\nRaw materials have value-added by operations. Value-adding occurs when pur -\nchased components are further transformed by the company\u2019s production process. \nThus, refining, processing, packaging, and shipping when done by the organization \nare value-adding and profit-making processes. All buyers of raw materials specify \ntheir required quality standards. Grains can be too dirty. All soy is not alike. Coffee \nprices vary with the perceived quality of the taste of the beans. Raw materials can \nbe bulky and require special spacious storage bins. Companies prefer to locate their \nrefining operations near the source of raw materials, so they do not have to transport \ntons of materials from which pounds or even ounces are eventually derived for use.\nOrganizations that are in the business of supplying raw materials at the very \nstart of the upstream acquisition process are themselves dependent on purchas -\ning. A quick summary includes the equipment to dig in the mines or harvest the \ncrop. The deposits in which the mines are located must be acquired. The land to be \nplanted and farmed must be procured. Mining requires tools and lubricants, and \nfarming demands seeds and fertilizer. This leads to the somewhat trite statement \nthat \u201cevery organization has a supplier.\u201d\nSecond, components and subassemblies are purchased materials that have greater \nvalue-added than the raw materials. They are, in fact, composed of raw materials \nthat already have experienced value-adding. Components and subassemblies are \ncharacterized by some degree of fabrication, assembly, and manufacture.\nThey are assembled into higher-order products by combining them with each \nother and with other parts made by the producer. This produces the third class of \nmaterials that need to be managed. Work in process can be stored and eventu -\nally shipped as finished goods. Work in process has more value-added than the \npurchased subassemblies. There is a progression of value-adding that starts at raw \nmaterials and moves up the supply chain to finished goods\u2014sold and shipped.\nInventory management encompasses the widest spectrum of activities related \nto materials. Let us start with the primary activities which include when and how \nmuch to make or purchase. In addition, timing of replenishments and decisions \nabout storage are important decisions as well.\nInventories serve several functions in an organization. The main function of \ninventories is to reduce the interdependency of various stages of the production \nand delivery system. Consider three subsystems of an organization representing the \nsupplier, production, and the market. These three subsystems are rigidly connected \nwith each other, without any inventories, as shown in Figure 5.1.\nRaw materials and purchased parts are flowing from various suppliers to \nmanufacturing, and finished products are going from manufacturing to the mar -\nket.

See data in Table \n6.7 for multiple ties. The problem is not solved here but is included as Problem 10. \nThe examples that we considered show ties in the first iteration. However, the ties \nmay occur during any iteration. The general rule is to break the ties at random. \nHowever, in this chapter, we will break the ties in the alphabetic order, that is \nA before B, etc. If the tie is for the same job on the two machines (Case 3), the \nties will be broken by the rule: machine M1 before machine M2. All resulting \nsequences, irrespective of the tie-breaking rule, will give the same minimum value \nof the make-span.\n6.4 Single-Machine Scheduling\nThere is a single machine on which several jobs have to be processed.

There are two major types of causal statistical studies, experi -\nmental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the \neffects of \n \ndifferences of an independent variable (or variables) on the \nbehavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between \nthe two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be \nvery effective.\nAn experimental study involves taking measurements of the \n \nsystem under \nstudy, manipulating the system, and then taking additional \n \nmeasurements \nusing the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified \nthe values of the measurements. In contrast, an \n \nobservational study does \nnot involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered and \ncorrelations between predictors and response are investigated.\nAn example of an experimental study is the famous Hawthorne studies, \nwhich attempted to test the changes to the working environment at the \nHawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company. The researchers were \ninterested in determining whether increased illumination would increase \nthe productivity of the assembly line workers. The researchers first mea -\nsured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an \narea of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected the \nproductivity. It turned out that the productivity indeed improved (under \nthe experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized \ntoday for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a \ncontrol group and blindedness.\nAn example of an observational study is a study which explores the \n \ncorrelation between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically \nuses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest, and then \nperforms statistical analysis of the observational data. In this case, the \nresearchers would \n \ncollect observations of both smokers and nonsmokers, \nperhaps through a \n \ncase-control study, and then look for the number of \ncases of lung cancer in each group.\nThe basic steps of an experiment are as follows:\nPlanning the research, including determining information sources, \u2022\t\nresearch subject selection, and ethical considerations for the \nproposed research and method\nDesigning experiments, concentrating on the system model and the \u2022\t\ninteraction of independent and dependent variables\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Coke\u2019s arch competitor, Pepsi-Cola, was engaged in full-scale combat \nwith an innovative product line that was attacking Coca Cola with alarming suc -\ncess. Under such circumstances, it is generally agreed that an innovation attack \nrequires an innovation counter-attack. To ignore competitive attacks is a big mis -\ntake, but it is crucial to test with care before rolling out an entirely new product.\n11.4.1  Failure Might Turn Out to Be an Unexpected \nOpportunity\nCoke provided its competitive response by reformulating traditional Coke with \n\u201cnew Coke.\u201d This was announced by the Coca Cola Company on April 23, 1985. It \nwas soon apparent that \u201cnew Coke\u201d was a disaster. Formerly loyal customers hated \nit. The Coca-Cola Company then returned to the original formula. They called it \n\u201cCoke Classic.\u201d It is said that huge marketing expenditures were required to recover \nfrom this fiasco. We have only common sense to back this up. However, there is no \ndoubt that New Coke\u2019s failure was due to flawed innovation. Coke paid an enor -\nmous penalty for the new product concept error that had been made. Why had the \nentire new concept not been rigorously tested? No Coke explanation is available for \nwhat happened.\nCoke handled this matter brilliantly. It took this fall; then recovered by renounc-\ning the mistake and grew an ever-larger market share as a result. Although we do \nnot know the real story behind the screen, we do know that Coke recovered and \nimproved its market situation. There is every reason to believe that in so doing, the \ncampaign for Coke Classic was tested, modified, and directed by rigorous analysis. \nA strong recovery, as in this case, required carefully orchestrated innovation.\nRecovery from failure often engenders stronger bonds between customers and com -\npany. We do not know of any documented case where failure was used as a competi-\ntive strategy from which to recover with an even stronger market franchise, but it \nmay be a feasible strategy if done correctly. Our own personal experiences tell us \nthat this is the case.\n11.4.2 Failure Caused by Inadvertent Process Change\nMany processes are improved by innovations that consumers never see. Instead, they \nreap the rewards in terms of quality enhancements. Also, processes are changed to \nincrease consistency of output. The result is a product innovation through process \nimprovement. Sometimes, however, a process change is made without testing the \nconsequences. Again, there can be bad results.\nAs an example, again for the beverage industry, the Perrier story follows.

State project objectives clearly. They should be reduced to the simplest terms \nand communicated to all team members. There often are many participants \nin a project, and knowledge about objectives must be shared.\n 2. Expertise is required to outline the activities of the project and sequence them \ncorrectly.

Accurate and achievable time and cost estimates for all project activities are \nessential. Slippage from schedule often means real trouble, whereas at other \ntimes it can be tolerated because there is sufficient slack. Slack is a time buffer \nthat will be precisely defined in a later section. Project management requires \nknowing which activities to monitor and expedite.\n 4. Duplication of activities, in general, should be eliminated. Under some \ncircumstances, however, parallel-path project activities are warranted, \nnamely:\n a. If a major conflict of ideas exists and there is urgency to achieve the \nobjectives, then it is sometimes reasonable to allow two or more groups to \nwork independently on the different approaches. Preplanned evaluation \nprocedures should exist so that as soon as it is possible the program can \nbe trimmed back to a single path.",

Calculations continue in this way resulting in total backorders of 1484.\nWe are now ready to determine total cost as follows.\nTotal idle time costs are the sum of Row 10 or the total of Row 8 (147) mul -\ntiplied by 25 which is equal to $3675. Total backorder cost is the Row 11\u2019s sum \nwhich is $148,400. Note that backorders sum to 1484 (Row 9) which is multiplied \nby $100\u2014the cost of a unit backorder. The total production during regular time \nis 5855.83. Therefore, the regular time labor cost is $468,480 after rounding total \nproduction (5856 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 20). The total material cost after rounding total produc -\ntion is $585,600 (5856 \u00d7 100). There is a production level change. The produc -\ntion level changes from 21 to 23.33 in January. After this, the production level \nremains constant at 23.33. Therefore, the cost of changing production level is $466 \n(2.33 \u00d7 200). The total cost of this plan is $1,206,621.\nThis is the worst result of all the plans (including those discussed in Example 2) \nthat we have studied. It is 7.5% worse than the worst of all of the prior plans. The \nresult is not surprising because total backorder costs in Example 3 (for service sys -\ntems) are too large and likely to get out of control. That suggests two things. First, \nincrease the number of technicians and let the idle cost go up; second, opt for a chas-\ning strategy. It might do better. In the Problem section, there is a request for analysis \nof the chasing strategy for the blood-testing laboratory. Doing the work entailed \nwill provide great benefits. Refer to the chasing model for the manufacturer. Find \nout how much better the chasing strategy will be for the blood-testing laboratory. \nWe need to recognize that service systems are (generally) more efficient when they \nfollow the chasing demand strategy than when they use the level strategy.\nSummary\nEveryone leads a job shop life. There are many things to accomplish. Flow-shop \ntype routines are partial, at best, and changing all of the time. Everyone must do \nAP to cope with such a great variety for the use of their time and money. AP for the \ncommercial job shop is an internal production management function. It constantly",

The probability of acceptance will be about 95% for p = 0.1; and \nit will be about 45% for p = 0.35. This means that as the quality of the lot decreases \n(an increase in the value of p) its acceptance probability decreases. This phenom -\nenon may be observed for all the three OC curves.\nNow let us compare the probability of acceptances of the three OC curves for a \ngiven value of p, say p = 0.35. See the vertical line at 0.35 and read the probabilities \nwhere it intersects the OC curves on the Y-axis. The probability of acceptances are \napproximately 12%, 43%, and 76% for c = 0, 1, and 2, respectively. This means \nallowing more defectives in sample (larger c) increases the probability of acceptance.\nIt may be noticed that when c is increased there is a marked decrease in the dis-\ncriminating ability of the sampling plan. This is because the probability of accept -\ning a lot with a given value of p rises significantly when the acceptance number \n(c) increases. For example, when c = 2, the probability of acceptance at p = 0.05 is \nalmost one and it decreases to about 0.69 (at p = 0.4). This shows a decrease of 0.31 \nin the probability of acceptance. For c = 0 the change in probability is from 0.78 \n(for p = 0.05) to 0.09 (for p = 0.4). This shows a decrease of 0.69 in the probability \nof acceptance.

[This definition \nis taken from the APICS Dictionary. The American Production and Inventory \nControl Society (APICS) is a professional society that has played an influential \nrole in the inventory management area.] We should note that APICS changed its \nname to The Association of Operations Management to emphasize that operations \nmanagement encompasses inventory control as well as many other (equally critical) \naspects of all production systems.\nWho manages inventory? Management of inventory is a major P/OM respon -\nsibility. How to manage inventory is dependent on the type of inventory that is \ninvolved. Most types of inventory situations are best handled by well-designed \ncomputer systems that utilize as much centralization of record keeping and order \nplacement as is feasible. The manifold advantages of the systems perspective with \ncentralized buying includes the fact that larger quantities provide stronger supplier \nrelationships, bigger discounts, a more informed choice of suppliers, and less chance \nfor mistakes (with respect to crucial factors such as price, quality, and reliability).\nEach of the six classes of inventory situations described below requires its own \ntype of management even though they can all be centralized or decentralized \naccording to the dispersion of use for producers, suppliers, and customers:\n 1. Order repetition\u2014static versus dynamic situations.\n 2. Demand distribution\u2014certainty, risk, and uncertainty.\n 3. Stability of demand distribution\u2014fixed or varying.\n 4. Demand continuity\u2014smoothly continuous or sporadic and occurring as \nlumpy demand; independent.\n 5. Lead-time (LT) distributions\u2014fixed or varying. LT is the interval between \norder placement and order receipt (including recognized need to create an \norder and place it).\n 6. Dependent or independent demand\u2014when components are dependent on \none or more end items, the information system must be able to calculate \nlinked demands.\n5.2.1 Static versus Dynamic\nTo explain order repetition, static inventory models have no repetition. They por -\ntray \u201cone-shot\u201d ordering situations, whereas dynamic inventory models place orders \nrepetitively over long periods of time. A few examples underscore the practical nature \nof this distinction between only one order and a repetitive stream of orders for the \nsame item placed over time. Dynamic models are the primary focus of this chapter.\nThe pure static case also is called a one-period model even though under some \ncircumstances a corrective \u201csecond shot\u201d may be allowed. The \u201cChristmas tree prob-\nlem\u201d is a good illustration of the static situation.

Variable costs are added to fixed costs, which \nare usually assumed to be the same at all volumes, even at zero production level. \nVertical distances in the triangular area lying between the fixed cost line and \nthe total cost line measure the variable costs. Line 3 in Figure A.1 is the total rev -\nenue line.

The upper-shaded area between the same lines rep -\nresents profit to the company. Profit occurs to the right of the BEP.

Many people can think of an inspiring leader they have encountered \nwho has nothing whatever to do with business: a politician, an officer in \nthe armed forces, a Scout or Guide leader, a teacher, and so on. Similarly, \n \nmanagement does not occur only in the context of business. Again, we can \nthink of examples of people who we have met who fill the \n \nmanagement \nniche in nonbusiness organizations. Nonbusiness organizations should \nfind it easier to articulate a non-money-driven inspiring vision that will \nsupport true leadership. However, often this does not occur.\nDifferences in the mix of leadership and management can define various \nmanagement styles. Some management styles tend to deemphasize leader-\nship. Included in this group, one could include participatory \n \nmanagement, \ndemocratic management, and collaborative management styles. Other \nmanagement styles, such as authoritarian management, micromanage -\nment, and top-down management, depend more on a leader to \n \nprovide \ndirection. Note, however, that just because an organization has no \n \nsingle \nleader giving it direction, this does not mean it necessarily has weak \nleadership. In many cases, group leadership (multiple leaders) can prove \neffective. Having a single leader (as in a dictatorship) allows for quick and \ndecisive decision making when needed, as well as when not needed. Group \ndecision making sometimes earns the derisive label committee-itis because \nof the longer times required to make decisions, but group leadership can \nbring more expertise, experience, and perspectives through a democratic \nprocess.\nPatricia Pitcher (1994) has challenged the division into leaders and man-\nagers. She used a factor analysis (in marketing) technique on data \n \ncollected \nover eight years and concluded that three types of leaders exist, each with \nvery different psychological profiles: artists were imaginative, inspiring, \nvisionary, entrepreneurial, intuitive, daring, and emotional; craftsmen \nwere well-balanced, steady, reasonable, sensible, predictable, and trust -\nworthy; and technocrats were cerebral, detail-oriented, fastidious, uncom-\npromising, and hard-headed. She speculates that no one \n \nprofile offers a \npreferred leadership style. She claims that if we want to build, we should \nfind an \u201cartist leader\u201d; if we want to solidify our position, we should find a \n\u201ccraftsman leader\u201d; and if we have an ugly job that needs to get done like \ndownsizing, we should find a \u201ctechnocratic leader.\u201d Pitcher also observes \nthat a balanced leader exhibiting all three sets of traits occurs extremely \nrarely: she found none in her study.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Extreme weather conditions, such as cold and heat, cause facilities to deterio-\nrate faster than normal weather conditions. Extreme wind conditions, such as \ntornadoes and hurricanes, require special building protections. Even humid -\nity must be taken into account.\nHow can the many tangible and intangible costs be brought together in a uni -\nfied way? Scoring models provide a satisfying means for organizing and combining \nestimates and hard numbers. This topic is covered in the next section.\n10.7 Facility Selection Using Scoring Models\nThe scoring model of facility location provides a relative weight to each factor that \naffects the location decision. The objective is to choose the location considering all \nrelevant factors. We describe the scoring model using hypothetical data given in \nTable 10.1. A six-step process is described below.\nStep 1: All factors that affect the location are identified. For this example, these \nare listed in the column \u201cFactor Name\u201d in Table 10.1.\nStep 2: Each factor is assigned a weight that gives the relative ranking of vari -\nous factors. For example, labor productivity has a weight of 0.15 (or 15%). \nNearness to the sources of raw materials is the most important factor (25%). \nThe total of all weights should add up to 1.0 (100%).\nStep 3: Alternative locations that have been under discussion are then listed. For \nthis problem the following potential international sites are identified: Chile, \nMexico, Honduras, and Brazil.\nStep 4: Each alternative is evaluated and is given a score on a ten point scale (it \ncould be a 100-point scale) for each alternative. The score for each location \nand for each factor is given in Table 10.2. For example, for labor productivity, \nChile scored 8 points, Mexico scored 7 points, Honduras scored 3 points, and \nBrazil scored 6 points. These points are given by the managers based on their \njudgments. A team of experts may be involved in giving these scores.\nStep 5: The total score for each location is calculated by multiplying the \nweight of each factor by the points it earned (weight \u00d7 score) and then",

For this reason, \nadministrative and supervisory costs are usually treated as fixed charges. Together \nwith purchasing and sales, they are all bundled together as overhead costs. Salaries \nand bonuses paid to the CEO and to every other manager are overheads because \nthey cannot be assigned to specific products and services.\n10.9.3 Revenue\nTotal revenue, TR = P*Q, is the volume Q multiplied by the price per unit P. When \ngoods and services are sold in the marketplace, they generate revenue. This break -\neven model treats revenue as a linear function similar to variable costs. Each unit \nsold generates the same amount of revenue equal to the price (P). An assumption of \nbreakeven analysis is that all units made and stored are delivered and sold.\nThe breakeven analysis question is: How many units of throughput need to be \nsold in order to recover costs and breakeven? The results change over time as fac -\ntors vary. Fixed costs often grow, prices change, and variable costs per unit decrease \nwith proper P/OM attention.\nWe illustrate the use of breakeven analysis for plant location decisions with the \nhelp of the following example.\n10.9.4 Example\u2014Musuk Spices Company\nMusuk Spices Company (MSC), Delhi, India, manufactures high-quality spices \nprimarily for the domestic market. However, MSC sees a big potential in the export \nmarket and therefore wishes to set up a manufacturing plant exclusively for its \nexport division. MSC is considering two locations for establishing the new plant. \nThe two locations are Bhopal and Agra in India. MSC has determined that the \nfixed costs per year will be $450,000 and $300,000 per year for Bhopal and Agra, \nrespectively. The variable costs per pound are expected to be $10/lb. for Bhopal and \n$14/lb. for Agra, respectively. The selling price is expected to be $30/lb. Musuk \nwants to pick up one of the two locations.\nUsing the concept of breakeven analysis, described in Appendix A, the break -\neven points for the two locations are calculated below using the following equation.\n \nBreakevenp oint BEP Fixedc ost\nSelling priceV ariablec ost\nBEP\n() ,= \u2212\n(() , ,,\n() ,\nBhopal lbs\nBEPA gra\n= \u2212 =\n= \u2212 =\n450 000\n301 0 22 500\n300 000\n301 4 18,, .750lbs",

Crosby (1979) demanded \na zero-defects goal which treats any failures as intolerable. Another point of view is \nto learn from failures so that no failure is ever repeated. In this regard, it may be \nimportant to note that certain systems must fail from old age and repeated use. \nGood quality managers protect their systems from adverse effects of such failures. \nTherefore, it is the system that avoids failures and with proper maintenance compo-\nnents that fail are removed and replaced before they degrade systems performance.\n8.3.1.2 Warranty Policies\nA product warranty is a guarantee by the producer to protect the customer from \nvarious forms of product failure. The specifics are spelled out in contractual fashion. \nThus, it is typical to state for how long a time, and for how much use, the product is \ncovered. The conditions of use are generally stated. One topic of common concern \nis whether companies are capable of offering warranty periods that are calculated \nto provide minimum costs because product failures start right after the covered \nperiod expires. For the most part, this assumption is bogus. Companies may wish \nthat they could be so smart.

Their service policy includes \nfurnishing an estimate by mail or phone before beginning work. Service policies are \ntaken very seriously by customers who require service. Organizations distinguish \nthemselves from one another by the care that they show and the fairness of their \nservice policy.\n8.3.1.4 Functional Human Factors\nQuality management must focus on the importance of human factors such as \nsafety, security, comfort, and convenience.

Assign work centers with large unit flow rates between them to locations as \nclose as possible.\n 2. Assign work centers with small unit flow rates between them to locations as \ndistant as possible.\nIn Table 10.7, look at those pairs of work centers that have the largest work-flow \nrates between them. These are in descending order: Work center 4 to work center \n1 has a flow of 120 units. Work center 5 to work center 1 has a flow of 110 units. \nWork center 1 to work center 2 has a flow of 100 units. Assign these work centers \nto locations that are as close as possible. Note (in Table 10.6) that the distance \nbetween A and B is 10 feet and between C and D is 12 feet.\nUsing the data in Table 10.6, the biggest distances are between locations A and \nD (32), and between A and E (40). This means that Layout-1, A (1), B (2), C (3), D \n(4), and E (5), assigned 120 units to the second biggest distance (viz., 32 between \nA and D) in the matrix of Table 10.7. Further, Layout-1 assigned work center 1 to \nlocation A and work center 5 to location E. It means that 110 units were assigned to \nmove the largest distance between locations\u2014viz., 40 between A and E.\nTo follow the heuristic \u201cassign the largest number of units to the shortest dis -\ntance\u201d would mean assigning work center 1 to A and work center 4 to B. That was \ndone in Layout-2, which reassigned work center 4 to location B. Because work cen-\nter 1 was already assigned to A, the next best distance from A is 20 at C. Therefore, \nwork center 5 was assigned to C in Layout-2.\nThe second part of the heuristic calls for assigning the centers with the smallest \nwork-flow rates between them to the locations that are as distant as possible. The \ntwo smallest flow rates between centers (in the matrix of Table 10.7) are as follows: \nWork center 5 to work center 2 has a flow of 5 units. Work center 5 to work center 3 \nhas a flow of 5 units. From Table 10.6, the shortest distances from C to D is 12 and \nfrom C to E is 15. Therefore, assign work center 3 to location D and work center 2 \nto E. This is Layout-2 (the revised assignment) shown in Table 10.9.\nThe heuristic did its job, but it is not clear whether further improvement is still \npossible. Trial and error with the improved matrix can be used to test further shifts.\nThe literature on layout has suggested the use of various mathematical tech -\nniques and the use of computerized algorithms.

The open \nstyle is the simplest. It consists of headings and open areas in which data \ncan be collected. The boxed style allocates space to each data item. Each \nbox is clearly identified by name or by a brief description. Forms are sel -\ndom purely \u201copen\u201d or purely \u201cboxed.\u201d They are usually described as pre -\ndominantly open or boxed, or as a combination of both. Completed forms \nare considered records.\nTypical control of the forms requires a number to be assigned to the \nform. This number is usually found in the footer section of the form. A \ndate is commonly found next to this number signifying the date the form \nwas placed into use. These forms are then listed on the document master \nlist. The storage location, filing method, and retention times must be iden-\ntified for completed forms (or records).\nb lue P rints (Pr O duct sP eci F icati O ns)\nProduct specifications developed internally should be identified along \nwith a revision letter code which can be cross-referenced in some man -\nner to a definition of what changed.

When applicable, much cleri-\ncal work is eliminated. This two-bin system is well suited to small items such as nuts, \nbolts, and fasteners. These are items too small and too numerous to make withdrawal \nentries for each transaction. The same reasoning applies to recording withdrawals of \nliquids, for which the two-bin system approach is also ideal. See, for example, the \napplication of two-bin system concept in effective management of a nursing ward for \nreplenishment of supplies method (http://www.hec.ca/pages/sylvain.landry/en).\n5.11 Periodic Review (Fixed Time) Inventory Systems\nPeriodic inventory systems are based on review of inventory levels at regular fixed \nreview periods. These systems were more popular than perpetual inventory systems \nbefore inventory information was digitized and put online. These were ideally suited for \nmanual entries and when actions should be taken periodically rather than randomly.\nComputers outmoded periodic manual systems primarily designed to save \nmoney on the clerical aspects of tracking inventory. However, periodic inventory \nsystems continue to be used for other reasons. These include requirements of suppli-\ners concerning the timing for accepting new orders, requirements of shippers about \ntiming deliveries, meeting the schedules of customers, and fulfilling the need to \ncombine orders to obtain volumes sufficient for shipment discounts.\nSome organizations have central warehouses that will only accept orders from \ntheir regional distributors once in a week. Each region expects deliveries on a dif -\nferent day of the week. Further, some industries prefer the regularity of the periodic \nmethod, which can be linked to changeover intervals for production processes as \nwell as the phases of projects. For example, the stages of buildings must be synchro-\nnized with what suppliers deliver.\nPeriodic inventory systems also play a part in an advanced class of inventory \nmodels (called Ss policies) that combine the ordering rules of perpetual and peri -\nodic order systems to obtain lower total costs. These blended methods can be \nencountered in big inventory systems installations such as the Armed Forces use.\nThe optimal interval for periodic review, t0, is based on the square root relation-\nship given in the following equation:\n \nt S\nDH0 = 2 .\nThe equation for t0 can be derived as follows:\n \nt Q\nDD\nDS\nH\nS\nDH0\n0 12 2== \u2217= .",

If QOL is not improving, at least it must not be degraded. That is a tried \nand true principle upon which to base sustainability. It translates into \u201cpreserv -\ning the environment, staying \u201cgreen,\u201d and allowing only responsible developments. \nFrom both a corporate and governmental point of view, P/OM champions sustain-\nability as a means of being and remaining successful. There are enough examples of \norganizations that could not sustain their early successes to serve warning on those \nwho cannot innovate in the face of dire threats. Since technology development is \nmoving faster and faster, the cycles of innovation and investment are required to \nspeed up as well. P/OM project management must be adjusted accordingly.\nSection 11.2 has addressed the fact that every organization, whether striving for \nfuture success or working to protect present achievements must adapt and master \ntransitions. The speed of change has accelerated because of extensive innovations \nin communication methods and transportation technologies. The rate of change is \naccelerating for new products and their underlying processes. Transition manage -\nment and innovation may be so similar in their definitions, and in their basic char-\nacteristics, that they become indistinguishable, one from the other.\n11.3  Competition for New Ideas, Resources, \nand\u00a0Customers\nAll organizations must innovate to stay relevant and to continue to succeed. That \nis because everything is changing in their environments (e.g., technologies, tastes, \ntaxes, temperatures, and training). The number of noteworthy competitors for any \nmarket (goods and services including humanitarian operations) has increased. The \nworld is no longer divided into territories (countries and even regions) with pro -\ntected boundaries.\nThe costs of transporting materials have become so insignificant relative to \nother costs of doing business that location is often of secondary importance. For \nexample, if the cost of moving products and resources great distances from low-cost \nproducers to markets has less impact on total costs than the low production costs, \nthe latter trumps in decision making. In the long run, however, the costs of trans -\nporting materials to production sites and the costs of transporting finished goods \nto markets is sheer waste. Better systems can be found that cut out transport costs.\n11.3.1 Patent Protection of Innovations\nNew technology cannot be guaranteed to be protected even by strong patents. In \nlarge measure, the twentieth-century concepts of the U.S. Patent Office do not \napply to technological developments of the twenty-first century. There is increas -\ning internationalization of the patent system with national offices in Japan, China, \nKorea, Europe (EU), Germany, etc. Almost every country has its own patent laws",

One answer is to ask for evaluations after specific \ncustomer experiences, such as hotel stays or meals in a restaurant. Making it clear \nthat an honest reply can lead to improvements in service appears to be an effec -\ntive inducement. Increasingly companies are doing this\u2014and rewarding compliant \ncustomers with a free appetizer.\nWhen a \u201csevere\u201d complaint arises, significant remediation must occur. A sincere \neffort to make amends often leads to significant re-bonding of customer and com -\npany. Strengthened bonds of loyalty have been noted when the customer appreci -\nates the redress of grievances. The innovation required is finding the remedy that \nwill satisfy alienated customers at a reasonable cost. For the large pizza chain previ -\nously discussed, remedies should cost less than $8,000.51. Otherwise, the remedy \nwill cost more than the cure is worth. Also, a small percent of customers will never \nbe appeased no matter what forms of compensation are offered. The Coke example \n(Section 11.4.1.) provides another case of recovery from failure and the benefits of \nredressing grievances.\nFrequent flyer programs are an airline innovation that has been a great suc -\ncess. Airline loyalty programs were considered a remarkable innovation when in \n1972 United Airlines gave plaques to their top-flight customers. In 1979, Texas \nAirlines created the first real frequent-flyer program (by present standards) using \nmileage tracking on which to base rewards. Today, credit card use for many kinds \nof purchases has augmented mileage achievements. This additional innovation has \nbecome another source of revenue for airlines\u2014sorely tested by huge increases in \nfuel costs.\nThe fact that getting new customers is far more costly than holding on to \nexisting customers has led to the adoption of retainment programs in numerous \nindustries. Retail stores, restaurants, hotels, trains, and airlines have added loyalty \nincentives with discounted gift cards, upgrading of services, special deals. To retain \ncustomers who are intrigued with the \u201clatest and the greatest\u201d yearly upgrades of \ncar designs and cell phones are commonplace. Innovations yet to come will increase \nthe length of the loyal lifetime period\u2014by offering rewards for staying year after \nyear. Properly done, the cost of switching brands can play an important role. Not \nonly must customers learn the intricacies of a new device when switching from one \ntechnology to another; they must also change the \u201ccloud\u201d that contains their pro -\ngrams, music, books, etc. This is another new class of innovations, namely, innova-\ntions of infrastructures (often called ecosystems) that are designed to make it costly \nfor non-business consumers to switch suppliers.\nHow do consumer products such as toothpaste and shampoo deal with the \nholding vs. switching problem? As before, the cost of holding is significantly less \nthan the cost of getting a customer loyal to another brand to switch to our brand. \nCoupons are bestowed on loyal customers to keep them from wandering. Strong \nbrands are continually innovating claiming their new formula can make teeth \neven whiter and brighter. Marketing contributes greatly to reinforce loyal cus -\ntomers\u2019 beliefs that they have always selected the best brand. Cognitive dissonance",

Testing proceeds dur-\ning each level of integration through full-up system testing, developmen -\ntal testing, and operational testing, thereby reducing program risk. System \nreliability is calculated at each test level. Reliability growth techniques and \nfailure-reporting, analysis, and corrective action systems (FRACAS) are \noften employed to improve reliability as testing progresses. The drawbacks \nto such extensive testing are time and expense. Customers may choose to \naccept more risk by eliminating some or all lower levels of testing.\nIt is not always feasible to test all system requirements. Some systems \nare prohibitively expensive to test; some failure modes may take years to \nobserve; some complex interactions result in a huge number of possible \ntest cases; and some tests require the use of limited test ranges or other \nresources. In such cases, different approaches to testing can be used, such \nas accelerated life testing, the design of experiments, and simulations.\nThe desired level of statistical confidence also plays an important role \nin reliability testing. Statistical confidence is increased by increasing \neither the test time or the number of items tested. Reliability test plans are \ndesigned to achieve the specified reliability at the specified confidence level \nwith the minimum number of test units and test time. Different test plans \nresult in different levels of risk to the producer and consumer. The desired \nreliability, statistical confidence, and risk levels for each side influence the \nultimate test plan. Good test requirements ensure that the customer and \ndeveloper agree in advance on how reliability requirements will be tested.\nA key aspect of reliability testing is to define failure. Although this may \nseem obvious, there are many situations where it is not clear whether \na failure is really the fault of the system. Variations in test conditions, \noperator differences, weather, and unexpected situations create differ -\nences between the customer and the system developer. One strategy to \naddress this issue is to use a scoring conference process. A scoring confer-\nence includes representatives from the customer, the developer, the test \norganization, and the reliability organization, and sometimes indepen -\ndent observers. The scoring conference process is defined in the state -\nment of work. Each test case is considered by the group and \u201cscored\u201d as a \nsuccess or failure. This scoring is the official result used by the reliability \nengineer.\nAs part of the requirements phase, the reliability engineer develops a test \nstrategy with the customer. The test strategy makes trade-offs between the \nneeds of the reliability organization, which wants as much data as possible, \n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

It is quite usual to choose a location and then search \nfor a specific structure and site. Often, the list consists of combinations. Various \nlocations, each with attractive sites and/or structures, are cataloged. Location and \nstructure-site decisions eventually are considered simultaneously. If no structures \nare found in a chosen location, building is often an option.\nThus, North Carolina and Tennessee could be chosen as tax-advantage states \nin the United States. If market differentials exist, they also could play a part in the \nselection among regions of the country. After choosing location, the search for sites \nand structures becomes more specific. In comparing alternatives, all relevant ele -\nments of location, site, and structure should be included. If relocation is involved, \nthe decision may be to select a new site or stay with the current one, and redesign \nand rebuild the facility.\nWork configuration influences structure decisions. Flow shop structures permit \nserialized, sequential assembly with materials being received and introduced to the \nline as close as possible to the point of use. Access by suppliers at many points along \nthe walls of the building is needed. Gravity-feed conveyors can be used instead of \nmechanized conveyors when the structure is multistoried. There are many similar \nconsiderations that arise that relate the building type with the work configuration. \nPart of the design of a good flow shop is the design of the structure.\nJob shops do not entail large investments in the design of the process. In gen -\neral, good flow shops do require large capital investment. It follows that the kind of \nstructure that will be adequate to house job shop processes is less restricted than for \nflow shops. More real-estate choices are suitable for job shops than for flow shops. \nRentals are more likely to be feasible for job shops than for flow shops or for flexible \nmanufacturing systems (FMSs).",

A few of these \nare described in the following paragraphs.\nSkinner (1969), in his article, Manufacturing\u2014Missing Link in Corporate \nStrategy, has advocated for a top-down approach for manufacturing operations. \nAccording to this approach, the manufacturing policy is developed starting with \nthe company and its competitive strategy. Skinner states, \u201c\u2026 that only when basic \nmanufacturing policies are defined can the technical experts, industrial and manu -\nfacturing engineers, labor relations specialists, and computer experts have the neces-\nsary guidance to do their work.\u201d\nSkinner (1974), in his article, Focused Factory, observes that \u201cThe conventional \nfactory attempts to do too many conflicting production tasks within one incon -\nsistent set of manufacturing policies.\u201d The lack of focus makes the plant noncom -\npetitive. A focused factory provides avenues to avoid suboptimization of individual \nelements and promotes identification and building on competitive strength. A \nsharp focus results from good systems perceptions.\nDrucker (1990), in his article, Emerging Theory of Manufacturing , puts forward \nfour principles and practices for a new theory of manufacturing. These include \nstatistical quality control (SQC), new developments in manufacturing accounting, \nmodular organization, and a systems approach that \u201cembeds the physical process of \nmaking things, that is, manufacturing, in the economic process of business, that is, \nthe business of creating value.\u201d\nStarr (1965, 2010) noted the potential strategic impact of designing products for \nmanufacture that shared common components. Some components could be inter -\nchanged with others, for example, some (otherwise identical) laptops have black \ncases, while others have aluminum finishes. The manufacturing process is where \nthe color and finish of the case is determined. Product and process designers must \nwork together to achieve such manufacturing modularity. Such modular produc -\ntion is the achievement of predesigned component interchangeability. However, \nmodularity is not always achieved by the production line. External modularity is \na consumer option exemplified by a light fixture with a standard screw base that \naccepts a variety of light bulbs, for example, 40 W, 100 W, clear, frosted, yellow. \nSimilarly, Michelin has many different kinds of tires that can be mounted on the \nsame car. Both forms of modularity raise productivity.\nMerrifield et al. (2008), in their article, The Next Revolution in Productivity, focus \non the role of new web-based developments in improving productivity.

Deficiency needs must be met first. Once \nthese are met, seeking to satisfy growth needs drives personal growth. The \nhigher needs in this hierarchy only come into focus when the lower needs \nin the pyramid are satisfied. Once an individual has moved upward to the \nnext level, needs in the lower level will no longer be prioritized. If a lower \nset of needs is no longer being met, the individual will temporarily repri -\noritize those needs by focusing attention on the unfulfilled needs, but will \nnot permanently regress to the lower level. For instance, a businessman at \nthe esteem level who is diagnosed with cancer will spend a great deal of \ntime concentrating on his health (physiological needs), but will continue \nto value his work performance (esteem needs) and will likely return to \nwork during periods of remission.\nd\neficiency \nn\needs\nThe first four layers of the pyramid are what Maslow called \u201cdeficiency \nneeds,\u201d or \u201cD-needs\u201d: if they are not met, the body gives no indication of it \nphysically, but the individual feels anxious and tense. The \n \ndeficiency needs \nare survival needs, safety and security, love and belonging, and esteem.\nPhysiological \nn\needs\nThese are the basic human needs for such things as food, warmth, water, \nand other bodily needs. If a person is hungry or thirsty or her body is \nchemically unbalanced, all of her energies turn toward remedying these \ndeficiencies and other needs remain inactive. Maslow explains, \u201cAnyone \nwho attempts to make an emergency picture into a typical one and who \nwill measure all of man\u2019s goals and desires by his [or her] behavior during \nextreme physiological deprivation, is certainly blind to many things.

The photographs are worth the \nvisit to this web page. Many projects require unending updates, maintenance, and \nrenewal. Consider the continuous updates of computer programs.\nProjects often include some repetitive activities. Building several houses on one \nland subdivision is a project. Software programming is a project even though use is \nmade of modular components (object-oriented programming). Projects may entail \nbatch work and even some intermittent flow-shop work. However, the project itself \nintegrates activities as it moves toward completion much as each additional chapter \nis written for a book or floors are added to buildings.\nProjects can be classified by degree of simplicity to change things. Design changes, \nwhich result in engineering change orders (ECOs), may appear to be minor altera -\ntions in the product design. However, even simple changes require alterations of the \nprocess that can lead to systems complexities. A small design change can destroy \nthe ability of fixtures to hold the parts for all downstream activities. Also ECOs \ncan multiply in number and lead to severe quality problems. These problems are \nespecially noticeable if there is insufficient time to test the interactions of the pro -\nposed changes with each other and with usage patterns. Having too many ECOs \ncan disrupt the normal business of an organization.\nProjects can be classified by degree of complexity reflecting the number of people, \nteams, components, and activities. Often, the number of issues to consider is very \nlarge. Building a new factory is complex. It requires doing a great variety of things \nthat have not been done before. Building another McDonald\u2019s may seem, at first \nglance, to be highly repetitious. However, locations are different. Community offi -\ncials and their rules are different. Time is different and things change over time (see \n\u201cSelect Country/Market\u201d at http://www.mcdonalds.com).\nProjects can be classified by frequency of repetition . Although NASA has \nlaunched many shuttle flights, they are not all the same. Challenger blew up on \nlaunching (January 28, 1986) because of special conditions. Seventeen years later \n(February 1, 2003), Columbia burned up during reentry. Again, unique conditions \napplied. Between these dates, hundreds of successful missions were flown. In space \nprograms, it is essential to define what scenarios can be deemed repetitious; what \nparts are unique and unknown?\nThere are benefits from having repetitive activities within a project. Housing devel-\nopments consist of the same house design being built many times.This allows parts to \nbe purchased with quantity discounts. Training for repetitive activities is readily justi-\nfied. The same activity plans (charts) can be used. As the project frequency increases, \nthe project mindset must remain in place. When you plan for regularities, you must \nalso plan for contingencies. We are reminded that object-oriented programming calls",

Therefore, the totals of supply \n(90,000) and demand (90,000) match. In a more general and complex problem, the \nsupply and demand may not match.\nTransportation Cost\nTable A.1 shows the cost of transportation per unit from each plant to each dis -\ntributor.

The fol -\nlowing four major charts are discussed in this chapter: x-bar Charts, R-Charts, \np-Charts and c-Charts. The SQC methodology also includes Acceptance Sampling \n(AS). We have devoted one section to each of these charts and to AS because of \nthe importance of SQC to organizational success. A discussion of run charts is \nincluded in the section where we explain the construction of control charts.\n8.5.1 Data Check Sheets (DCSs)\nData check sheets (DCSs) primarily organize the data. They are ledgers to count \ndefectives by types. They can be spreadsheets, which arrange data in a matrix \nform when pairs of variables are being tracked. These are used for recording and \nkeeping track of data regarding the frequency of events that are considered to be \nessential for some critical aspect of quality. For a particular product, there may \nbe several data points required to keep track of different qualities that are being \nmeasured. It is useful to keep these in the same time frame and general format \nso that correlations might be developed between simultaneous events for the dif -\nferent qualities.\nA data check sheet, such as shown in Figure 8.5, could record the frequency of \npower failures in a town on Long Island in New York State. The data check sheet \nshows when and how often the power failures occur. The DCS is a collection of \ninformation that has been organized in various ways, one of which is usually chron-\nologically. The information about when power failures have occurred can be used \nin various ways. First, it provides a record of how frequently power failures arise. \nSecond, it shows where the failures occur. Third, it can reveal how quickly power is \nrestored. Fourth, it can show how long each type of failure (A\u2013F) has to wait before \nreceiving attention, usually because work crews are busy on other power failures. \nAfter the data check sheet is completed, problem identification follows. Then causal \nanalysis by type of failure and location can begin. Organized collection of data is \nessential for good process management.\n8.5.2 Bar Charts\nBar charts represent data graphically. Often data are converted from check sheets \nto bar charts and histograms. Figure 8.6 shows a bar chart for the recorded number \nof power failures that were listed on the data check sheet (Figure 8.5). The six types \nof failures listed as A through F on the data check sheet are represented with sepa -\nrate bars in Figure 8.6. The number of incidents is shown by the y-axis. Bar graphs \ncompare the number of single-event types (e.g., types of complaints). A separate bar \nis used for each data set. The types should be chosen to be operationally useful, that \nis, something can be done to reduce the number of incidents.",

That will be done shortly.\nIf two standard deviations were used the UCL and the LCL will be 30.79 and \n29.81, respectively (calculations not shown here). In that case the 3:00 P.M. point \nwould be outside the control limit. The 3:00 P.M. point was 30.90. This outlier could \ntrigger a costly process evaluation, which might not be justified. The x-bar value of \n29.85 for the third subgroup is uncomfortably close to the LCL value of 29.81 lead-\ning to the possibility of another costly trigger. For this process, where a safety margin \nhas been built into the system, three-sigma seems more satisfactory than two-sigma.\n8.8 Control Charts for Variables: R-Charts\nThe x-bar chart is accompanied by another kind of control chart for variables. \nCalled an R-chart, it monitors the stability of the range.

There can be a very high cost for this lack of information if the patient \nhas an unknown critical situation that must be diagnosed on the basis of blood test-\ning. In reality, the doctors could indicate a priority for testing urgency. Blood tests are \nbeing postponed because there is a shortage of testing personnel or of testing supplies, \nor of testing equipment. These are the main reasons that a shortage cost is incurred.\nAlso, when an urgent situation exists, there is the opportunity to subcontract \nwith another laboratory or employ overtime.\nIn service situations, shortage costs are usually based on estimates of lost revenue \nif delay causes the hospital to switch to another laboratory. There is certainly some \ndamage to the laboratory\u2019s image. Losing a grade-A reputation can affect adversely \nfuture business and revenues. In this example, we assume that the demand is back -\nlogged. Neither patients nor doctors are happy. The shortage cost is specified as per \nunit outage per period of time.\nRegular time labor cost is a function of the normal hourly wage rate for blood-\ntesting technicians, and the number of hours worked during regular time in each \nmonth. Similarly, the overtime labor cost is a function of the hourly overtime wage \nrate and the number of overtime hours worked. Subcontracting costs can be quite \nsubstantial if, for example, outside testing is used when \u201cour\u201d laboratory does not \nhave the proper equipment or skill sets.\nThe material cost per unit is the cost of the chemicals used for testing.

Flexible manufacturing systems \n(FMSs) are designed to produce a high variety of outputs at low cost. Computer-\ncontrolled changeover is engineered into the system. Instead of human hands chang-\ning machine settings, electronics and mechanics provide the interface between \nthe computer and machinery. Flexible technologies allow for fast and inexpensive \nchangeovers. The equipment can be programmed to move from one product setup \nto another product setup in nano-times.\nUsing FMS, design and machine software talk to each other. CAD software \ncreates new design drawings. It runs tests on all important reliability and durability \ncharacteristics, such as fatigue strength. CAD communicates design specifications \nto software that translates, instructs, and controls the production machinery, that is, \nCAM.

To further complicate the picture, resellers who purchase the \ncomponent and then brand and sell it with some added service under their own \nname are often referred to as OEMs. For this text, we use the second definition \nabove. For example, Apple is a famously successful OEM buying component parts \nfrom many suppliers including some of its competitors.\nChoi and Linton (2011), in the article, Don\u2019t Let Your Supply Chain Control \nYour Business, mention that \u201ca heavy reliance on first-tier suppliers is dangerous for \nOEMs. It weakens their control over costs, reduces their ability to stay on top of",

It is \nsenior management\u2019s responsibility to find the optimum balance between \nrevenue, cost, and expected market share while setting objectives.

PPP starts as a concept rather than a method for \ndeveloping new products. It replaces planning for one product (goods and services) at \na time. The one-at-a-time concept is now pass\u00e9. The speed with which product devel-\nopment occurs has accelerated at such a great rate that planning a product in isolation \nfrom its further updates and revisions is untenable. In this regard, it is important to \nread a 15-page article, Planning for Product Platforms (Robertson and Ulrich, 1998).\nPlatform planning can be based on logical evolution (e.g., increasing screen size \nor decreasing thickness). It can also benefit from swapping out less good components \nfor better ones (e.g., upgrading memory size or using more pixels). Entirely new \nfunctions can be added (e.g., GPS-Global Positioning System, or rear view camera \non a car). New colors are often added to the original palette. Additional sizes make \nsense for a variety of products including those which are forms of clothing. New \nforms of service can be extended as product innovations. At-home healthcare moni-\ntors can permit doctors and nurses to evaluate a patient\u2019s condition without requir-\ning a personal visit.\n11.6.3 Continuous Innovation Using Product Modularity\nModularity is a production strategy that has been utilized in special ways for many \nyears (Starr, 1965). It is based on the concept of swappable components any one of \nwhich can be plugged into the mother unit (and it does not have to be a computer). \nEach swappable component has its own capabilities for doing the job. For example, \nthese components can represent different interior color designs for a car. Various \nmotors produce different amounts of suction for a vacuum cleaner. Modular com -\nponents have a standard interface which permits any one of them to be plugged into \na space reserved for one or another of the swappable components.\nElectric plugs within any one country are interchangeable in relatively stan -\ndardized sockets but different systems prevail in various countries making it neces -\nsary to use adapters. Electric bulbs are highly modular and fairly well standardized \nbut there are many exceptions. The Edison screw base has been made to dimen -\nsions prescribed by international standards since 1909. LED (light-emitting diode) \nlamps and CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) are made with Edison bases precluding \nmajor problems replacing incandescent lamps. Most Edison screws have a right-\nhand thread that tightens when the bulb is turned clockwise. However, to deter \ntheft, some installations are based on left-hand threads (e.g., some hotels and the \nNew York City subway system).\nAdditional examples include various size motors (for kitchen waste disposal units) \nthat fit into the same container under the sink. In general, interchangeable motors \n(of varying HP) and power supplies of different wattages can be designed to provide",

The three subsystems are linked in such a way that there is \nno inventory stocked in-between them. Therefore, the impact of any disruptions \nin any one of the subsystems will be felt in the other two. For example, if produc -\ntion output stops in manufacturing because of some reason such as power failure, \nmachine breakdown, a strike, etc., then it will not be possible to supply the goods in \ntime to the customers, hence affecting the market subsystem. Similarly, if suppliers \nfail to supply raw materials and purchased parts in time, then the manufactur -\ning subsystem, and in turn, the marketing subsystem will be affected. The manu -\nfacturing subsystem itself may consist of several subsystems representing several \nproductive facilities. These manufacturing subsystems are also interlinked and the \nperformance of any one of them is affected by the performance of the others.\nOn the other hand, if we have an inventory bank in-between each pair of the \nsubsystems, then inventory can dampen the effect of disruptions in one system \non the other. In this case, if the supplier is unable to supply the raw materials and \npurchased parts in time, then production will not suffer for the want of raw mate -\nrial because the stored inventory of raw material can be utilized. Similarly, if the \ndemand is fluctuating in the market, then the inventory of finished goods can help \nto absorb these fluctuations and their influence is not felt by the production depart-\nment. In the same way, production subsystems operate independent of each other \nbecause of the inventory of semifinished goods.\nThus, inventories help in reducing the dependence of one subsystem over the \nother. Stock on hand acts as a shock absorber and gives a cushioning effect to the \nturbulence in one subsystem so that the same is not transmitted to other subsys -\ntems. It should be pointed out that inventory only helps in diminishing the inten -\nsity of the impact of disrupted operations in one subsystem over other subsystems \nand does not eliminate it completely because the amount of inventories is limited.\nInventories also help in developing level production plans when production \ndoes not fluctuate.

When this occurs, we must apply the concepts \nof project planning. A project plan (see Table\n \n2.8) is made up of significant \nevents or milestones that must occur in some time sequence in order for a \nproject to be completed. A project plan is a schedule of tasks over the dura-\ntion of the project. Project plans are an effective means of depicting a project \nschedule and reporting progress as it occurs. The type of plan most often \nused is a Gantt-type chart, as shown in Table\n \n2.8. When viewing this plan, \nyou should remember that the responsible manager should have a list of all \nthe projects under his or her control along with their associated status. In \nturn, each project on the list is then delegated to a project manager.\ng\neneral \ni\nnformation\nThe general information section of the plan again identifies the \n \nresponsible \nparties for the project, along with associated departmental responsibility \nand accountability.

This is particularly true when \ntransportation costs are a large part of the cost of goods sold. Location also may be \ncrucial because of labor being available only in certain places. Closeness to market \ncan affect demand. Closeness to suppliers can affect prices and the ability to deliver \njust in time. Tax considerations often play a part.\nOnce the location is known, a search for appropriate building structures can be \ndone. However, when several locations are considered suitable and when buildings \nhave been identified that qualify, then the various packages of locations and struc -\ntures have to be considered together.\n10.2 Who Does Facilities Planning?\nThe treatment of all four of the facilities planning issues is classic P/OM. Their \nimportance is not in question, but the way that these four issues are treated and the \nrole of P/OM in the planning process have been changing. In the global world of \ninternational production systems, international markets, and rapid technological \ntransfers, facilities planning requires a team effort. It is no longer the sole respon -\nsibility of P/OM.\nTeam effort is required to deal with the issues properly. They deserve consid -\neration by the entire strategic planning team of which P/OM is one important \nmember. Beside the fact that all functional areas should be participants in location \ndecisions, there are additional considerations.\nGovernmental regulations\u2014from international to national to municipalities\u2014\nhave to be addressed. Legal issues need to be resolved. Lawyers from many coun -\ntries often are consulted. There are negotiations with communities regarding such \nmatters as financial incentives and tax breaks.\nTo rent, buy, or build requires specialists who know domestic and interna -\ntional real-estate markets. Trade rules and tariffs are special for trading blocks and \ntheir partners. They are constantly changing for General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade (GATT), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), European \nUnion (EU), and other trade groups.\nCurrency conditions and banking restrictions must be interpreted by spe -\ncialists. The list of special complications to consider is long and particular to \neach situation.\n10.3 Models for Facility Decisions\nP/OM\u2019s role and its contributions to facilities management are primarily of three \nkinds.

This \nmethod is useful for establishing a relationship between two sets of numbers that \nare time series. For example, when a series of Y numbers (such as the monthly \nsales of cameras over a period of years) is causally connected with the series of \nX numbers (the monthly advertising budget), then it is beneficial to establish a \nrelationship between X and Y in order to forecast Y. The first assumption that is \ngenerally made in regression analysis is that the relationship between the correlate \npairs is linear. It is the easiest assumption to check. However, if nonlinear relations \nare hypothesized, there are strong, but more complex methods for doing nonlinear \nregression analyses. In regression analysis, X is the independent variable and Y is \nthe dependent variable.\nExample: Consider the data given in Table 3.11. This table gives 10 observations \nfor the values of X (independent variable) and the corresponding values of Y (depen-\ndent variable). The data are plotted in Figure 3.7.\nWe can fit a straight line (called the regression line) to this data. This line will \nbe an estimate of the way in which the value of X affects the value of Y. For this \nexample, a linear trend is assumed. Once the line is determined, it can be used to \nextrapolate future demand\u2014the value of Y.

This trend continues until the minimum project duration is reached. The \nguiding principle for crashing process time is: crash an activity (or several activities \nin the case of multiple critical paths) if the total cost of crashing the activities per \nweek is less than the fixed cost per week.\n7.13 Crashing Multiple Paths\nAs discussed above, in the case of multiple critical paths, activities on all critical \npaths have to be crashed. We may crash an activity common to all critical paths or \ndifferent activities on each path. The activity (or activities) to be chosen depends \non the crashing costs. Consider the data given in Table 7.8. This project consists \nof two paths. Path 1 consists of activities a\u2013b\u2013c and Path 2 consists of activities \na\u2013p\u2013q.

It concerns dangers from products in use and services provided such as \nplane trips and taxi rides. Many human factor qualities are overlooked until they \nexceed reasonable limits and are then rejected. For example, the comfort of a chair \nin a restaurant might be considered acceptable until it passes a threshold, and then it \nbecomes a factor for evaluation of the restaurant. Using market segmentation accord-\ning to body types, only some customers may find the restaurant chair uncomfortable.\nMany safety factors cannot be seen. Starting in 1996, Firestone ATX tires got a \nreputation for tread separation causing SUV rollovers. In 2006, Bridgestone Firestone \nCorp. was still trying to reach the 5% of original tire owners for replacement. Word \nof mouth in such situations has a large negative effect. Proper P/OM heads off the \nexistence of such issues. Food safety is another invisible factor. Customers rely on \nfood companies to take proper measures to ensure that salmonella is not present. \nContaminant control is a P/OM responsibility. Why are there so many warnings and \nrecalls? The answer is the P/OM is not given the authority to monitor and control \nat all stages of product design, development, and production. Management saves \nmoney and time on a short-term basis only when there is no one to guard the system \n(i.e., negligence overrides the production control system).\nThe health quality aspects of foods related to processing and ingredients such \nas trans-fatty acids and partially hydrogenated oils is a quality issue. Nutritionists \ndecry the use of too much fat, too many calories, too much sodium, etc. P/OM \nmakes the product that uses these ingredients. However, the recipes are part of the \nproduct design, which relates to management strategy, marketing planning, and \nmarket research information. Because the underlying properties of food are invis -\nible to the consumer, labeling has taken on importance that is proportional to the \nconsumer\u2019s ability to use that kind of knowledge. Problems of many kinds can be \ntraced to inadequate and incompetent strategic planning.\n8.3.1.5 Nonfunctional Quality Factors\u2014Aesthetics and Timing\nNonfunctional qualities play a major role in the consumer\u2019s judgment of quality. \nAppearance and style are intangibles, and customer satisfaction with aesthetics \nis costly to measure. There can be high variability in what constitutes preferred \ndesigns, and there are ambiguous design criteria for what works. Because appear -\nance, style, and other non-functional qualities are intangibles, expert opinion and \nmarket research are the only ways to measure satisfaction. Nevertheless, these \ndimensions are as important to the definition of product quality as any that are \nfound in the functional categories of quality.\nMarket research often attempts to determine the image that consumers con -\njure up of themselves to justify the purchase of items. Self-image is significant for \nhigh-ticket items such as Rolls Royces or Mercedes. Self-image applies to a broad \nrange of acquisitions such as health club memberships, art purchases, top-of-the-\nline cameras, maid service, and trips into space on Russian satellites.",

Bureaucratic systems are rampant worldwide. North America and \nEurope have more than their share, and they are equally prevalent in Asia, Latin \nAmerica, and Africa. The definition of the term that is being used here is bureau -\ncracy as institutionalized officialism, which has layers of red tape to cut through \nin order to conclude activities and operations. Bureaucracy spreads its reach as it \nproliferates through an organization placing controls over controls in the quest for \nlow risk. It should be emphasized that all systems have an inherent risk aversion \nthat results in their developing methods to protect the status quo.\nThe positive side to bureaucracy should not be overlooked. In the late nine -\nteenth century, Max Weber was an advocate for legal domination (law admin -\nistered by the state). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Max_Weber_works \nfor Max Weber\u2019s works. Weber viewed bureaucracy as a force to counteract the \nKafka-like (unpredictable intimidation and lack of civil rights) effects of traditional \ndomination (feudal rules determined by monarchs and patriarchs).\nIn regard to positive aspects of bureaucracy, it can be noted that bureaucracy \nplays an important stabilizing role in organizations that are undisciplined and \nprone to accidents. Routines known to be safe are insurance against risk of cata -\nstrophic damage. The down side of bureaucracy is that the pendulum always swings \ntoo far. Once bureaucracy gains control, it strives to remove corrective counter \nswings and maintain existing conditions. The status quo often impedes progress \nand supports rigidity.\nFlexibility is related to productivity in a number of ways. Conditions change \nand the ability to adapt to new situations is a function of the system\u2019s flexibility. \nNew technology and the need to be global are among the most important changes \nin conditions that require flexibility. Product life is shorter and the need to modify \nproduct designs requires flexibility. The productivity advantages associated with \nproducing large volumes of identical units is being replaced by mass customization \nmethods that permit small volumes having greater variety to be produced. Design \nvariations are being used for different countries and even for various regions of the \nsame country. Carrying out strategic plans requires flexibility.\nBureaucratic organizations are dedicated to resisting change. What P/OM must \ndeal with in fulfilling strategic plans is how to circumvent bureaucracy, which is, by \nintent, the protector and champion of the status quo. Bureaucracy is the opponent \nof operational change. When bureaucratic constraints are removed, often by decen-\ntralization, and more recently by reengineering, afflicted organizations regain some \nability to rebound. However, there is always the danger of not having a carefully \nthought-out plan in place before un-constraining the system.\nJapanese organizations that exhibited great resilience when they first started their \nmajor export drives also began to succumb to the problems of age and success. Age is cor-\nrelated with circulatory insufficiencies in human beings and a lack of communication",

This \nmatrix is symmetric so the distance from A to D (32 feet) is the same as the distance \nfrom D to A.

Work centers are equipped to do specific kinds of jobs\u2014like the press shop, \ncopy room, hamburger grill, and darkroom.

Industrial engineering methods are recognizable as the forerunners of \ntechniques that are currently applied in the search for continuous improvement.\nTaylor and his associates developed principles and practices that led to a pres -\nent-day backlash. He and other contributors to scientific management have been \naccused of dehumanizing the worker in pursuit of efficiency. Today, the accusation \nmight hold, but it did not when judged by the value system of the early 1900\u2019s.\nThe criticism does not damage the case for benefits that can be derived from \nusing the industrial engineering approach, which grew out of scientific manage -\nment. Work simplification and methods engineering are both industrial engineer -\ning techniques for making jobs better for workers.\n2.5.4 Sequenced Assembly (SA)\u2014P/OM\u2019s Third Step\nIn 1912, Henry Ford developed sequenced assembly, which allows assembly to be \na continuous flow shop process. Timing must be perfect so that what is needed \nfor assembly arrives on time. Ford developed the sequenced assembly process as a \ncontinuous flow production line for automobiles, changing the pace from batch to \ncontinuous sequenced assembly.\nThe serialized flow shop was born over a hundred years ago. The key was learn -\ning to achieve synchronization and control of the process flows. The moving assem-\nbly line required a high level of component interchangeability. Ford succeeded in \nachieving complete synchronization of the process flows. Today, with computers \nfacilitating smart supply chain management that reaches every corner of the world, \nsynchronization takes a lot of P/OM training and knowhow.\nBy means of the principles of interchangeability, division of labor, and flow \nsynchronization, Ford altered the production transformation process. He changed \nthe perception of productivity standards and goals in a conclusive way. In so doing, \nhe built an industrial empire that helped the United States become the world leader \nin productivity. The United States continues to maintain its lead, although other \nnations\u2014especially those once considered to be less developed countries (such as \nChina and India)\u2014have been improving their productivity consistently.\nFord\u2019s contribution to production theory and to the revision of the transfor -\nmation process had a major impact on the Japanese automobile industry. It also \naffected other industries of many kinds all over the world. There was a new rhythm \nto the transformation process.\nContrast US and Japanese production processes in the 1980\u2019s. The major portion of \nproduction and operations activities in the United States utilized batch processes. \nBatch work with small lots does not lend itself to the kind of synchronization that \napplies to the automobile industry or the continuous flows of chemical processes. \nBatch work costs per unit are much higher and its productivity is significantly lower \nthan synchronized flow shop per unit costs.\nWhen the Japanese export industry began to compete aggressively in global \nmarkets, they chose to shun batch-type production systems.

Figure 8.1b \nshows how the total profit may vary as the quality improves. One should strive to \nachieve the quality level at which the profit is maximized.\nSome producers may be endowed with an innate sense of how to set quality \nstandards so as to best balance costs and benefits. Most producers have to learn \nhow to deal with such issues. This is an essential part of what P/OM does since \nprocess design determines what can be gained from the application of total quality \nmanagement (TQM).\n8.3 Dimensions of Quality\nThe dimensions of quality are the descriptors that must be examined to deter -\nmine the quality of a product. The wine business is an enormous industry on a \nglobal scale. How do the presidents of wine companies characterize the quality \nof their products? They measure their production output by bouquet, color, and \ntaste plus chemical analyses. Cars are evaluated within categories of cost, by their \npower, safety features, capacities, fuel efficiencies, and style, among other things. \nAppearance and style dimensions, so often important, are difficult to rate. Experts \nat ladies\u2019 fashion shows are at no loss for words. Yet this billion-dollar industry is \nonly able to explain successes and failures after the fact. When rating the quality of \ncities to live in, the authors of such research base their studies on dimensions that \ndefine quality of life. The complex set of demographically sensitive criteria include \namount of crime, cost of living, job availability, transportation, winter mildness, \nand the quality of schools for families with children.\nThe starting point for managing quality is to define the relevant set of qual -\nity dimensions, recognizing the special needs of market niches and segments. Not \neveryone will agree about what should be on the list or about the importance of \nthe dimensions that are on the list. Individuality accounts for different perceptions \nabout \u201cwhat counts.\u201d\nA sample of customers was asked what qualities could be improved in the ser -\nvice they received from their bank. Their answers included the following: length \nof time waiting for tellers should be decreased; availability of officers for special \nservices should be increased; banks should be open longer hours; rates on interest-\nbearing accounts should be raised; and service charges should be dropped. The list \nwas long and not everyone agreed on the relative importance of these points. At the \nsame bank, a group of officers was asked to define the quality of the services their",

The total activity cost \nfor Schedule 6 is $106,850 ( = $103,850 + $3000) and the project duration is \n29 weeks. The project manager has to choose a particular schedule. How is this \ndecision made? Why should a project manager spend more money to expedite \nthe project? These questions can be answered by taking into account the fixed \ncosts of the project.\n7.12.4 Fixed Costs\nThe project costs that have been discussed above are the costs of completing an \nactivity. However, there are other project costs that are not activity-dependent but \nare time-dependent. These are called the fixed costs. For example, the salary of the \nproject supervisor will be a fixed cost if the supervisor is paid per week. Similarly, if \na builder, who is building an apartment complex, completes the project 2 months \nlate, he loses the rent that could have been earned if the project was completed on \ntime. The fixed cost is the rent lost for 2 months. Similarly, in the case of a new \nproduct development project, if a company can bring the product earlier to the \nmarket, it will start getting the returns on investment sooner.\nFor the example that we have been discussing (Tables 7.5 and 7.6), suppose \nthe fixed cost of the project is $800 per week. In this case, the fixed cost will be \n$32,000 ($800*40) if the project is completed in 40 weeks, and $23,200 ($800*29) \nif the project is completed in 29 weeks. Table 7.7 gives the activity costs, fixed costs, \nand the total costs for all project durations from 29 to 40 weeks.\nSome of the important observations from this table include the following. \nActivity cost decreases as the project duration increases; it goes down from \n$106,850 (for 29 weeks) to $97,000 (for 40 weeks). The fixed cost increases \nas the project duration increases; it increases from $23,000 (for 29 weeks) to \n$32,000 (for 40 weeks). The total cost first decreases as the project duration \nincreases, reaches a minimum, and then increases again. The minimum cost \nfor this project is $128,300 for the project duration of 35 weeks (Schedule 3 in \nTable 7.6 ).\nIt may be observed that as an activity is crashed by 1 week, the total cost of \nthe project goes up by an amount equal to the crashing cost of that activity and \ndecreases by an amount equal to the fixed cost per week. To observe this phenom -\nenon, let us review various schedules in Table 7.6. Schedule 1 requires crashing of \nI at a cost of $500. The fixed cost is $800. So crashing I by one week will reduce \nthe total project cost by $300. Observe in Table 7.7 that the total cost has gone \ndown from $129,000 (for a 40-week schedule) to $128,700 (for a 39-week sched -\nule). Schedule 3 (Table 7.6) requires crashing D at a cost of $700 per week. The cost \nadvantage will be $100 since the fixed cost is $800. Total cost is reduced by $100 \nper week as we move from the 39-week schedule to 35-week schedule. To make the \nproject duration 34, activity A has to be crashed by 1 week at a cost of $850. This \nwill increase the total project cost by $50 as can be seen in Table 7.7. Total cost",

The decision for what controls are \nneeded lies with the business manager. The team\u2019s conclusions as to what \nrisks exist and what controls are needed are documented, along with a \nrelated action plan for control implementation.\nThree of the most important risks a software company faces are unex -\npected changes in (1) revenue, (2) costs from those budgeted, and (3) the \namount of specialization of the software planned. Risks that affect rev -\nenues can be unanticipated competition, privacy, intellectual property \nrights problems, and unit sales that are less than forecasted; unexpected \ndevelopment costs also create risk that can be in the form of more rework \nthan anticipated, security holes, and privacy invasions.\nNarrow specialization of software with a large amount of research and \ndevelopment expenditures can lead to both business and technologi -\ncal risks, since specialization does not lead to lower unit costs of software \n(Messerschmidt and Szyperski 2004). Combined with the decrease in \nthe\n \npotential customer base, specialization risk can be significant for a soft-\nware firm. After probabilities of scenarios have been calculated with risk \nanalysis, the process of risk management can be applied to help manage the \nrisk.\nMethods like applied information economics add to and improve on \nrisk analysis methods by introducing procedures to adjust subjective \n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Once we \nsay that the \u201cexpected\u201d time is 34.83 weeks, the project manager will be interested \nin knowing the probability to complete the project in 34.83 weeks or any other due \ndate.

The vari-\nance may be zero for some activities when all three time estimates are the same \n(activity C, for example). Variances of all activities are given in Table 7.9.\nBased on the activity variances, the variance of each path can be calculated \nby adding the variances of all activities that belong to a particular path. From \nvariances, the standard deviation of each path can be calculated using the known \nresult in statistics that standard deviation ( \u03c3) = square root of variance.

We need to calculate the probability of completing each path by the \ndue date. For doing this, we calculate the z-value for each path using the formula \nz-value = (D \u2212 Te)/\u03c3, where Te is the expected completion of the path and \u03c3 is its \nstandard deviation.\nSuppose, the project due date is 36 weeks.

Vice versa applies. By increasing supplier\u2019s protection, buyers will \nbe forced to accept more defective products. Chapter 8 on quality management \nexplains this effect.\nAnother important tradeoff example that persists for materials managers is the \nwell-known relationship between the number of items purchased in an order\u2014and \nthe rate at which they are used up. With bigger orders, carrying costs go up and \nordering costs go down. This could result in fewer purchasing agents but a larger \nwarehouse is needed. Bigger orders are associated with the inventory philosophy of \njust-in-case when compared to smaller orders being just-in-time. Production and \noperations managers are generally very smart. They know it is better to overesti -\nmate order size (not only because of just-in-case risk management, but also because \npenalties for overestimating are lower than for underestimating).\nINTERDISCIPLINARY COORDINATION\nWe continue to examine the implications of using the systems approach for P/OM \nproblems. This text reveals many useful applications, but there are important loci \n(centers) of interdependencies that our Preface should address. Let us briefly con -\nsider, in turn, the important sets of relationships between production and operation \nmanagers and their colleagues in IT, market research, finance, accounting, and \nmarketing. The need to cooperate with IT, OR, and analytics has been discussed \nabove.\nMarket research provides the eyes and ears for awareness of the needs, wants, \nand complaints of customers from every demographic and market demand seg -\nmentation. Financial management is a very powerful, full-fledged associate in deci-\nsions about capitalization of technology. Process development is constrained by \nthese decisions which are illuminated by the application of breakeven analysis (first \nexplained in Chapter 10). See the Appendix for the fully developed breakeven anal-\nysis (as a straightforward quantitative model). After studying breakeven, students \nagree unanimously: accounting is an essential P/OM partner to properly develop \nthe costs that breakeven analysis requires.\nThe interdisciplinary coordination is very important in designing supply chains \nparticularly with a growing focus on e-business (see Chapter 9). e-Business is a \nmultidimensional discipline involving the application of technology, the study of \ncustomers\u2019 attitudes, expectations, and satisfaction, the identification of internal \norganizational environment, the study of the relationships among partners in the \nsupply chain, the development of collaborative strategies and coordination mecha -\nnisms, and the development of analytical models for operating (e.g., inventory and \npricing) decisions. The e-business area has been influenced by the developments",

Because material costs are now critical to profitability, most organiza -\ntions have created positions of high responsibility to oversee the many parts of the \nsystem that have to be integrated for materials management.\nMaterials management involves organizing and coordinating all management \nfunctions that are responsible for every aspect of materials movements and trans -\nformations\u2014called the materials management system. This system is triggered by \ndemands (including those forecasted) that deplete stocks, causing inventory man -\nagement to request replenishment through purchasing agents or direct contact with \nsuppliers or vendors.\nThere are three main classes of materials that have to be purchased and managed.",

The processes must be ongoing with item demand \nbeing relatively constant over time. It is evident that such modeling does not apply \nto job shops with small orders because they lack continuity of demand. The focus \nnow is on items that are stocked regularly, where the demand can vary. The buyer \norders the EOQ, but has on hand some buffer stock (which is sometimes called \nreserve stock or SS). The buffer stock is extra stock so that when demand is heavier \nthan expected, orders can still be filled.\nAn option is to design a perpetual inventory system. It is perpetual because \nit is an online system, tracking the stock on-hand (SOH) at each transaction of \nwithdrawal or stock entry. To design the system, it will be useful to answer the fol-\nlowing questions:\n 1. How many buffer stock units should be carried? \n  The answer involves balancing the added carrying costs for extra stock against \nthe costs of running out of stock. As one cost goes up, the other comes down.\n 2. When should an order be placed for the buffer stock? \n  The buffer stock should be created as soon as it is determined that it is benefi-\ncial to have it. It does not have to be replenished when it has been drawn on \nto avoid stock-outs because the use of buffer stock is expected to average out \nat zero. The only times that this will not apply will be if the demand system \nis changing over time or is unstable.\n 3. How often should an order be placed for buffer stock? \n  Once, and then whenever the buffer-stock level needs to be updated.\n 4. How many units should be ordered to meet expected demand? \n  Use the same economic order quantity.\n 5. How often and when should the orders be placed for units to meet the demand? \n  An order is placed whenever the reorder point, QRP, is reached.\n 6. How does this perpetual system work? \n  Withdrawal quantities are entered in the computer each time one or more \nunits are taken out of stock. These quantities are subtracted from the previous \nstock-level balance to determine the new balance quantity of stock on-hand.\n5.10.1 Reorder Point and Safety (Buffer) Stock\nThe RP quantity is designated for each item and is entered in the computer pro -\ngram. When the RP has been reached, the program recognizes this fact and an \norder is placed for the EOQ. The stock level of the RP (QRP) is equal to the expected",

Suits off-the-rack and then altered to fit are still customized but at \na lower level. Industrial consumers can also choose between altered to fit or tailor-\nmade equipment. The highest variety levels fall within that range of customiza -\ntion. P/OM produces the level of variety determined and set by marketing strategy. \nBecause variety entails additional production costs, marketing has to factor these \nexpenses into the equation. P/OM is in charge of the knowledge base in the busi -\nness unit that can inform marketing about the costs of variety. Together, marketing \nand P/OM examine the trade-offs between higher costs and greater sales. At the \nsame time, variety develops loyal customers in special market niches. Some custom-\ners prefer regular cola. Others prefer diet drinks. Some like vanilla or cherry added \nto the drink. Others like more caffeine. Some choose bottles and others choose \ncans. Choice is a quality that is a competitive factor. It must be understood by \nmarketing and P/OM alike.\nThe above factors that define the quality of a product or service lead to the \ndetermination of the cost of the product or service as discussed below.\n8.4 The Costs of Quality\nA good approach to understanding quality is to analyze the costs associated with \nachieving, or failing to achieve it. There are three basic costs of quality. These \ninclude the costs of prevention, appraisal, and failure. The nature of these costs is \ndiscussed below.\n8.4.1 The Cost of Prevention\nPrevention involves the use of conscious strategies to reduce the production of \ndefective product, which by definition does not conform to agreed-upon quality \nstandards. The entire system must be designed, coordinated, and controlled to pre-\nvent defectives. This includes the materials and equipment used, appropriate skills, \nand the correct process to deliver product conforming to standards. Generally by \nspending more, the percent of defectives can be reduced. Figure 8.2 shows this kind \nof relationship, although the real shape of the curve would have to be determined \nfor a specific situation.\nIf some mistake causes defectives to occur, and the problem is noticed and \ncorrected, then it is fair to say that quality improvement was free. Defectives have \nbeen prevented from occurring by remedying a wrong. In service organizations, \nas in manufacturing, there are many examples of cost-free quality improvements. \nPhilip Crosby wrote a book about quality being free (see Crosby, 1979) and estab -\nlished a quality school for executives in Winter Park, FL that emphasized this focus \nas part of its curriculum. The cost of prevention goes up when quality standards \nare raised meaning a lower level of defectives. It is a reasonable policy to raise the",

For making decisions \nin this complex and dynamic environment, we propose and highlight the use of \n\u201csystems approach\u201d in this book for studying, analyzing, and applying P/OM func-\ntions. The systems point of view requires consideration of P/OM dealing with all \nbusiness functions, such as marketing and finance.\nIf the part that operations managers play is to be effective, it should be systems-\nbased. Compare the operations manager to the coach of a sports team. What is \nthe coach\u2019s job for a baseball, football, basketball, or soccer team? It is to guide the \nteam to achieve competitive excellence. The coach knows that making the team \nwin requires coordinating the contributions of the individual players. Winning \ntakes teamwork, and the coach tries to develop that cooperative ability. Teamwork \nskills require a systems viewpoint. The systems viewpoint means that everything \nthat is important to goal achievement is included in the analysis. If the goals can -\nnot be achieved, then the strategies must be changed. Instead of the sports analogy, \nproduct line development can be used. The same teamwork requirement applies.\n1.2 Strategic Thinking\nThe systems viewpoint requires strategic planning. Goals and strategies must be \ncongruent and realistic. Assume that the game being coached is called business \nand that players\u2019 positions are known as marketing, finance, operations, etc. The \nsuccessful coach emphasizes coordination of these functions to pursue a strategy \naimed at achieving the objectives. Apply this same statement to football, baseball, \nbasketball, soccer, etc., and it works as well. Managers of all functional areas need \nto understand P/OM, and P/OM managers need to understand areas that interact \nwith their own. Understanding global competitors requires understanding their \nstrategies within the context of the international character of their operations man-\nagement systems. That is why this text directs P/OM managers to focus on the use \nof the systems approach for strategic planning and tactical actions. The need begins \nwith the development of strategies for product line planning. P/OM strategy is dis-\ncussed in more detail in Chapter 2; innovation and new product development are \ndiscussed in Chapter 11.\n1.3 Explaining P/OM\nP/OM is the work function that oversees making goods and providing services. Because \nit provides what others sell, finance, and account for, it is an indisputable partner in \nany business. Product line planning is the starting point for strategic planning.\nThis book will familiarize students with the language and abbreviations used by \nproduction and operations managers\u2014such as writing P/OM (or even faster, OM)",

For business units, the measures relate more directly to the kinds of activities \nthe company does. These are the operational measures of productivity used by an \norganization. Productivity measures should be adjusted to capture the relevant sys -\ntem.

This only works when the \ndegree of variability will not affect the solution. Then, certainty is assumed for \nconvenience and it does not violate the spirit of the model. LT for delivery is often \ntreated in this way. Suppose that 2 weeks is the average LT for a specific case. The \nvariability around the average will determine if 2 weeks can be used as if it were \ncertain. It is important that users of inventory models know when the certainty \nassumptions are allowable. When LT variability could cause a stock-out, it can -\nnot be treated as constant. Buffer stock is stock carried to prevent outages when \ndemand exceeds expectations. Basic inventory methods dealing with OPP make \nassumptions about the demand distribution that get translated into buffer-stock \nlevels. The OPP models on which this chapter focuses are based on demand and \nnot lead time variability. Order points are stock levels at which new orders are trig-\ngered and placed.\nUncertainty means that there is no good forecast for the probabilities of demand \nand/or LT distributions. When uncertainty exists, the probabilities for various lev -\nels of demand occurring are speculative. However, when there is a known risk, \nsome planning can be done. Delivery of critical materials from the port city of \nKobe in Japan always was totally reliable until the January 18, 1995, earthquake \ncaused serious delays. Some companies factor such possibilities into their planning \nand can react quickly. Another example is the 2003 strike in Venezuela, which led \nto an increase in the price of oil from $23 to $33 per barrel. The August 29, 2005, \nhurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and closed its busy port for months. \nSerious damage had been predicted years in advance. A number of companies \nincluding BMW, Hyundai, P&G, Home Depot, and Wal-Mart had plans in place \nto deal with the situation. The earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima Daiichi \n(March 2011) and the flooding in Thailand (October 2011) disrupted production \nfor Toyota and Honda in the United States for at least 6 months. Finite probabili -\nties always exist for various catastrophes. Having a team on hand, ready to assess \nthe situation, and find solutions can provide significant advantages.\nOrder cancellations may be a less severe disaster, but they are usually costly \nenough to make planning for the event worthwhile. Many production departments \nhave exposure to the risk that an order in process will be cancelled. Contingency \nplanning for cancellations shows better production management abilities than \nthose who react to cancellations after the fact.\nWhen forecasting is difficult because there is no history, systems are developed \nto search for advance warning. They are tuned in to whomever might have infor -\nmation about orders. Every effort is made to find the key players who originate the \norders and to keep them in the communication loop at all times. Other factors that \nmight trigger orders also are tracked. Efforts are made to gain some control over the \nuncertain occurrences.",

Goods refer \nto manufactured, assembled, and processed items. Goods are tangibles that can be \nproduced before their actual use and they can be inventoried. Services, on the other \nhand, are intangibles that cannot be inventoried. Services are provided at the time \nwhen the customers need them. The study of P/OM is the study of operations and \nprocesses leading to the creation of goods and services.\nThe terms \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d \u201cproduction,\u201d and \u201coperations\u201d are used inter -\nchangeably in the literature and also in this book to represent the P/OM field. \nSimilarities and differences between these terms do exist and have been explained \nin this chapter. However, if one term is more representative than the other to stand \nfor both P/OM, that term is operations management. Most production managers \nwill accept the appellation of operations manager but not vice versa. Therefore, \noperations management can be used instead of P/OM. Also, OM can be used in \nplace of P/OM; however, PM is not a good substitute for P/OM unless only manu-\nfacturing is clearly involved.\nIn the current information age, the importance of scientific decision-making \nhas increased hugely. Organizations have grown in size; they continue to become \nbigger and more global. With greater size, the complexity of operations has also \nincreased and the number of decisions to be made has expanded. Accurate and",

There is an absolute necessity for strong cooperation between these \ntwo primary players in new product and process development. Simply stated, prod-\nuct life (in a growing number and variety of product classes) has gone from years \nto months. The mobile phone bought in May could be technologically out-of-date \nby September. Old dishwasher detergent (liquid or powder) has been replaced by \ncapsules; high-efficiency (HE) laundry detergents are now used with the new wash-\ning machines; laptop computers are competing with a huge choice of digital gad -\ngets. Constant communication and intense connections between family members, \nfriends, and business associates are the essence of the information society which \nexperiences unexpected repercussions and unintended disruptive consequences \nfrom the viral nature of sweeping attitudes.\nNew products are not sustainable if they are not conceived as a part of an evo -\nlutionary product line. Evolutionary product lines require evolutionary process \ndesigns. Chapter 11 describes these platforms for launching the next version of a line \nof successive replacement products. This dynamic situation applies immediately to \ngoods\u2014especially to electronics and telecommunications (E&T). As E&T become \ndominant marketing features of automobiles, entertainment centers, living rooms, \nkitchens, part of clothing (wearable technology), etc., the speeded-up disruptive \neffects of E&T will become increasingly pervasive.\nThe changes apply to consumable goods as well. The effects of social media \nlead to rapid alterations in a range of likes and dislikes. Whole Foods and The \nFresh Market are not transients to the supermarket scene. Publix is morphing to \nmatch the organic and green appeal. Services may be slower to reflect the effects of \nsignificant variations of the product line, but they are occurring. Better and more \npersonal services are the beneficiaries of the E&T revolution. This includes recom -\nmendations for restaurants and competitive pricing advice from personal assistant \napplications such as SIRI (on iOS devices), Google Now, Speaktoit, Robin, and \nSherpa.\nThe demographic that relies on digital implementations is youthful and even \nyounger. Not so gradually that demographic segment is replacing the part of the \npopulation that is less reliant on E&T. The effect of this is that cross-discipline \ncommunication and subsequent coordination between product designers, mar -\nketers, and P/OM are becoming essential. The huge change taking place requires \nreorientation of all organizations about how business will be conducted in the \ntwenty-first century. P/OM will be at the core.\nThus, the project management component of P/OM is no longer an auxiliary \naspect of the field.

Middle managers \nand selected staff functions report to the manager of production or operations.\nFor example, department supervisors report to the manager of production and \noperations. The supervisor\u2019s position is a line job. In manufacturing, the supervi -\nsor, who is often called foreman or forelady, oversees some part of the production \nprocess. In service operations, the supervisor title describes the person responsible \nfor some specific function such as reservations or insurance premium collection. \nThe supervisor of a call center can have hundreds of people working for him or her.\nThis is a high-level position, but the character of the job depends upon the stage \nof the company. In Stage IV firms, this person will regularly be invited to lunch in \nthe board room because of top management\u2019s keen interest in operations.\n1.16.5  Inventory Manager, Materials Manager, or Purchasing \nAgent (and Supply Chain Manager)\nThe inventory or materials manager holds a staff position that is accountable for \ncontrolling the flow of input materials to the line. The function of this job is to \ndetermine when and how much to order, and how much stock to keep on hand. \nThere are myriad titles associated with these jobs. Many manufacturing and some \nservice firms have vice presidents of materials management because the cost of \nmaterials as a percent of the total cost of goods sold is high. In service firms such \nas Starbucks and JetBlue Airways, materials are similarly important. Service firms \ntend to have a larger labor cost component, and the airlines have high fixed costs. \nNevertheless, the cost of coffee has been rising, and fuel costs have been volatile and \nvery high. The inventory managers might consider hedging when purchasing coffee \nand kerosene.\n1.16.6 Director of Quality\nThere are a great number of jobs in the quality assurance area and even more titles. \nMost of these jobs are staff positions that range from auditing quality levels to \ndoing statistical analyses for control charts. The director of quality or quality man -\nager (who could be a vice president) is in charge of the various quality activities that \nare going on in the firm.\nIn some companies, line workers have been given quality responsibilities, so it is \npossible to find supervisors with quality team assignments and organizing quality \ncircles. Quality adjustments to inputs, including vendors, and to the transforma -\ntion process are common. Quality positions usually focus on improving the quality \nof outputs by inspecting for defects, preventing them from happening, and cor -\nrecting their causes.

It also is a measure of the purchas-\ning department\u2019s ability to find the best materials obtained at the lowest possible \ncosts and highest qualities.\nOutput delivered to the customer is a measure of the ability of the distribution \nsystem to be on time with undamaged delivery. Output delivered is subject to war-\nranties. Does the company listen to the \u201cvoice of the customers\u201d with respect to \ndifficulties in repairing or returning defectives for the entire product line? If not, \nfuture sales productivity can be impaired. Many companies lose track of the fact \nthat warranties exercised represent productivity decreases.\nProductivity issues are woven into all parts of the supplier\u2013producer\u2013customer \nvalue chain and the input\u2013output transformation process.

Demand volume falls as price rises, but this is also relative to what prices com-\npetitors charge. When a competitor lowers prices, it is equivalent to a price \nincrease for the customer who stays with a supplier who does not lower prices.\n 2. To be competitive, it is often necessary to find ways to match price decreases \noffered by competitors. This is a price\u2013demand volume elasticity issue that \nassumes quality is unchanged.\n 3. If marketing lowers the price, then the profit margin will decrease.\n 4. P/OM is always trying to find a way to decrease total variable cost without \ndegrading quality. For example, if a new material is developed that is as good \nas the old material but costs less, then P/OM shifts to the new material. This \ninitiative is called value analysis.\n 5. The only way to achieve number 4 is to work smarter, and this is facili -\ntated by means of technology-based or methodology-based productivity \nimprovements.\n 6. Marketing tries to control demand volume through pricing. If competition \ndrops the price, based on an improved process, emulation of the improve -\nment is needed.\n 7. P/OM tries to match supply to demand through production scheduling and \ncapacity planning. Marketing and P/OM must work together, combining \ntheir interactions by using the systems approach.\n2.4.5 Elasticity of Quality and Productivity\nThe demand volume of goods or services sold as a function of price is the traditional \nfocus of elasticity analysis. Years ago that simple model may have sufficed, but it no \nlonger is valid.\nFor strategic planning, it is vital that marketing determines how quality levels \nof the product line affect competitive status (demand volume at a given price). In \nturn, P/OM must ascertain the unit costs for various process configurations oper -\nating at appropriate production volume levels. This subject brings together many \nsystems factors that are of mutual concern to P/OM, marketing, and finance.\nCustomers in the marketplace take both price and quality into account. \nCustomers\u2019 quality expectations often override price considerations. This applies \nto commercial and industrial customers as well as retail consumers of goods and \nservices. For example, a gourmet restaurant cannot afford to serve meats and veg -\netables that might suffice for a neighborhood diner.\nAs previously noted, a product or service that has special qualities is said to have \nuniqueness, which means that other competitive products lacking those special \nqualities have a lower degree of substitutability. For example, a product with special \nfeatures (such as the iPhone) or service rendered by a well-liked person (favorite \nwaitress) has a competitive advantage. Competitive analysis will show when two \nproducts are competing head-on, as if they were identical products, being per -\nfect substitutes for one another. Perceived highest quality renders a product less",

Inset 5 shows the calcula-\ntions for the blood tests demanded per day.\nThe AP addresses the question: How does the laboratory plan to meet the fluc -\ntuating requirements? The answer depends on the costs and the production capac -\nity set by the planning strategies. Costs and capacity calculations applicable to the \nblood-testing laboratory are discussed in Section 4.5.1.\nDifferent numbers of working days occur in each period because of holidays \nlike New Years and Labor Day, and the different number of days in a month. We \nmultiply the number of workers by the number of hours per day (eight in this case) \nto find out how many regular time work hours are available per day for production. \nProduction rate per day is based on the number of workers available in the month \nand the hours required for one unit blood test.\n4.5.1 Costs in AP for the Blood-Testing Laboratory\nThe costs incurred in AP for the service system are differentiated in Inset 6.\nWe do not have inventory carrying (holding) costs in this service system exam -\nple. In this case, the cost of supply being greater than demand is associated with \nidle workers (paid by the hour) and blood-testing equipment sitting around unused. \nWhile this cost is difficult to determine, it can be calculated and it is specified as \ndollars wasted per unit per period. The inability to create inventory that can be used \nlater on when demand is greater than supply makes this a typical service example \nof aggregate scheduling.\nStock-out or shortage or backorder cost is the cost incurred for not meeting the \ndemand on time. When shortages occur, the demand is either lost or backlogged. \nIn this case, it is a cost for backlogging of demand for testing which means that the \npatient (customer), doctor and nurse, wait for the blood test order to be fulfilled in a \nINSET 5\nDemand per day: Blood test demand per day in a given month is a function \nof the demand in that month and the number of working days in that month.\nDemand per day = demand per month/working days per month\nSuppose in a given month, say March, the demand for blood tests is 600 \nunits and the number of working days is 22.

This calls for filling the order as soon as capacity is available or materials \narrive. Backorder costs include the penalties of alienated customers. To avoid this \npenalty, some mail-order companies prefer to fill customers\u2019 orders with a more \nexpensive substitute instead of creating a backorder. The outage cost is related to \nthe decrease in profit margin. However, the goodwill generated by the gesture is \nan intangible addition to long-term profit. Depending on the system that is used \n(i.e., backordering, substitutions, fill or kill, and so on), various costs of being out \nof stock will occur. The lost-goodwill cost is most difficult to evaluate.\nOrganizations that are not close to their customers frequently ignore lost good-\nwill. This may occur because the firm does not know how to measure or recognize \ngoodwill. Many bureaucracies are identified as neglecting customer satisfaction \ninadvertently by overlooking the job satisfaction of their employees who in turn \ndeal with the customers. Disgruntled employees alienate customers which means \nthere are fewer happy customers.\n5.3.6 Costs of Running the Inventory System\nProcessing costs that are associated with running the inventory system are referred \nto here as systemic costs. These costs are often associated with information system \ncosts called IT costs. This category of costs is usually a function of the size of the \ninventory that is carried and the importance of knowing exact stock levels on-line \nimmediately.\nA big part of systemic expense is keeping up with incessant supplier cost changes, \ncustomer demand alterations, carrying cost modifications, labor costs for keeping \nrecords, and technology alteration costs. Costs are related to the number of people \noperating the inventory system. Operating costs also include systems assistance, \nprogramming, and training costs. Training costs are high in well-run IT systems, \nespecially when labor turnover is significant and technology improvements acceler-\nate. The amount of time that the system operates (many times round-the-clock) \nand the number of locations that are networked into the centralized data system \n(round-the-world) have to be factored into this cost.\nSystems involving many stock-keeping units (SKUs) are dependent upon hav -\ning an organized information system. There are different SKU part numbers for \neach model type, as well as for each size and color. Part numbers for SKUs iden -\ntify specific suppliers and indicate where inventories are stored. When there are \nfrequent online transactions with many SKUs, the amount of detail is great. Such \nsystems are labor-intensive and expensive to operate.\nIt makes sense to focus on the SKUs for materials and items that are critical for \nproduction. Also, it makes sense to pay special attention to items that have high",

Organizations set goals for the maximum time that can be allowed to elapse \nbefore answering a ringing phone. Airline travel delay is regularly published and the \nairlines are keenly sensitive to the measure.\nThe costs of production interruptions have previously been related to the criti -\ncal nature of inventory items. Lost inventory in the warehouse and errors in book -\nkeeping are causes of interruptions. Lost luggage in airline travel is an example of a \ncost to both the traveler and the airline. In 2010, the Air Transport Industry (ATI) \nBaggage Report stated that more than 29 million pieces of luggage were delayed, \ndamaged, or lost at the world\u2019s airports.\nSalvage costs can play important roles, as can the costs required for expedit -\ning orders. The costs of spoilage for food might be better handled as separate costs \ninstead of as a part of the carrying cost related to obsolescence. The pro-and-con \ncosts of central warehousing when compared to dispersed warehousing can be cru -\ncial. In various circumstances, one or more of these costs can dominate the inventory \npolicy evaluation. A strong systems study will look outside the typical boundaries \nof inventory costs to spot those factors that are influencing the cost/benefit system.\nWe will study the various analytical models to solve inventory problem under \nvarious situations.\n5.4 EOQ Model\nThe EOQ model, also called the square root model, forms the basis of inventory \ncontrol techniques. The EOQ model requires determination of the order quantity \nwhich is the amount of material (Q) to be purchased each time an order is placed, \ngiven the annual demand (D), the ordering cost per order (S), the inventory holding \n(carrying) cost per unit per year ( H), and the unit cost per item (C). Q is the deci-\nsion variable. The best value of Q, which minimizes the total annual cost, is called",

In the \nthird period, the demand (600) exceeds production (460) by 140 units. Therefore, \n140 units will be withdrawn from the inventory to meet the demand and the inven-\ntory decreases by 140 units to a total of 130 units.\nThis is how the inventory levels are calculated.

For example, suppliers compete for winning the man-\nufacturer\u2019s supply orders (the case of e-procurement) and retailers compete among \nthemselves for increasing their market share at the retailing stage. With the advent \nof e-business, the manufacturers have started competing with their own retailers by \nopening parallel Internet channels to sell their products\u2014a situation most preva -\nlent at the distribution stage\nThe advent of the Internet has paved the way for the emergence of mixed-\nchannel supply chains in which a manufacturer, through a direct (Internet) \nchannel, competes with his/her own traditional brick-and-mortar retailer for \nthe same consumer market. This creates a situation of conflict. Some of the \nstrategies to reduce conflict include: revisions in the wholesale prices, diver -\nsion of customers to the direct channel by the reseller for a commission, and \nfulfilling the demand only through the reseller (see Tsay and Agrawal, 2004); \nthe wholesale prices remain unchanged and the retailer sets his/her prices, the \nwholesale prices are adjusted to maintain the retail prices at the previous level \nand the wholesale price is determined to maximize the wholesaler\u2019s profit with \nno guarantee of maintaining the base wholesale or retail prices (see Cattani \net al., 2006); the retailer may be allowed to add other features and value to dif -\nferentiate his/her product offering from the one sold through a direct channel \nby the manufacturer, the retailer sets the price of the modified product, and the \nmanufacturer may also make a side payment to the retailer to reduce conflict (see \nMukhopadhyay et al., 2008).\nCompetition results in conflict which in turn leads the competing entities to \ncollaborate and coordinate to arrive at a win-win situation for everyone.\n9.9.3  Radio Frequency Identification\nRFID is an enabling technology for real time data collection and has a great poten-\ntial to support and promote e-business activities. RFID uses wireless non-contact \nradio-frequency electromagnetic fields for data transfer, to automatically identify \nand track tags attached to objects (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_\nidentification).

Production transformations were by hand. Output volumes were very \nsmall.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution began (around 1770), craft guilds emphasized \npride of workmanship and training for basic manual operations with appropri -\nate hand tools. The shoemakers\u2019 children learned from their fathers and mothers. \nProcess techniques were manual skills handed down from generation to generation.\nFrom a transformation point of view, this was good management of the labor \ninputs. The use of apprentices improved productivity in the artisans\u2019 shops because \nthe less skilled (and lower paid) apprentices did much of the preliminary work. This \nfreed the master craftsmen to devote their time to the activities requiring higher \nskills. On-the-job training produced a continuous stream of greater skills.\nApprenticeship still has significance for many service functions. Great chefs \nalmost always are the pupils of great chefs. The formula would seem to reside in the \nbalance of art and science. When the important knowledge resides in the minds \nand hands of skilled workers, then the percent of art is high and the percent of sci -\nence is low. Over time, this percentage has shifted in manufacturing so that engi -\nneering, technology, and computer programming play an increasing role.\nThe art element in manufacturing is disappearing. Computer know-how is \nreplacing people know-how. It used to be that the tool and die department was \ncrucial to the success of metal-working companies, and the best die makers were \nconsidered artists. (Tools and dies are the shape formers in the metal-working busi-\nnesses.) Now, computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing \n(CAM) are primarily science, and the old industrial arts are giving way to the new \nprogramming arts. This is also happening in service industries and is an effect that \ncan be expected to accelerate in the future.\n2.5.2 Interchangeable Parts (IP)\u2014P/OM\u2019s First Step\nEli Whitney invented the concept of interchangeable parts for the fabrication of \nrifles around 1780, which coincides with the dates usually given for the beginning \nof the Industrial Revolution. The notion of interchangeable parts was the catalyst \naround which new methods for production transformation began to develop. These \nmethods spawned and supported the Industrial Revolution.\nWhitney was not the sole inventor of interchangeable parts. In France, Honor\u00e9 \nLeBlanc had invented the same P/OM concept. Neither Whitney nor LeBlanc \nknew about each other\u2019s ideas. Whitney obtained a US government contract for \n\u201cten thousand stand of arms.\u201d The contract was awarded because of his newly devel-\noped production capabilities.\nThe concept of interchangeable parts is defined as follows: It allows batches of \nparts to be made, any one of which will fit into the assembled product. For example, \nheadlights, fenders, tires, and windshield wiper blades are not specially made for \neach car. One 60-W bulb is like another and does not have to be fitted to each",

There are numer -\nous examples of failed innovations. Yet, increasingly, new products are the only \nmeans to bring about positive change in a company\u2019s status\u2014especially when there \nare competitive attacks. Innovation may be a necessity to survive but innovation \nfailures are a risk that can be avoided with due diligence. Management knows that \nchange is risky but good managers know that there is growing demand for them \nto take such risks. Smart risk-taking is a critical component of innovation ability.\nThe oldest (fallacious) version of sound management bureaucracy is that one \navoids failure by taking no risks. The best way to avoid risks (again fallacious) is by \nmaking no changes. So, when faced by doom, the consummate bureaucrat looks \naway. When faced by change from outside, that is not a prescription for success. It \nis not a way to avoid failure. Successful strategies must embrace well thought out \nchange. Random or careless changes will not succeed. How changes are designed \nand carried out will be crucial for success. JC Penney\u2019s might have been a successful \ninnovation if testing (including market research of prices and retail operations) had \nbeen properly employed.\nBefore we look at other examples of failures, let us amplify what is meant by \ntesting. Proper testing includes design of experiments followed by careful analy -\nsis. Smart information collection is vital. Ultimately, asking the right questions is \nessential. The building blocks of success require coordination of market research \nand P/OM planning using in-depth market analysis of relevant forecasts\u2014to assist \nwith P/OM evaluation of inventories, facilities, and staff needed.  P/OM must be able \nto synchronize all processes (e.g., retailing methods are production strategies) with \nmarketing strategies. Such prudence might have avoided most of the situations \ndescribed below, as well as the JC Penney example given above.\nAn often cited example of a product change that had a potentially catastrophic \nnegative effect was made by the (otherwise) brilliant strategic planning company, \nCoca Cola. For an explanation of how this could happen, it has been suggested to \nconsult the word \u201chubris.\u201d Another way of explaining this situation is \u201ca knee-jerk \nreaction.\u201d\nHere is the story: The Coca Cola Company launched an innovation called \n\u201cnew Coke.\u201d As a guess, newly hired managers convinced anxious older manage -\nment that innovation was essential to remain competitive.

It is common practice to say that starting time of A1 is zero (0) \nand the ending time is 5. The next operation A2 is to be done on machine M3 and \ncan start as soon as A1 is completed. It is shown to be scheduled on days 6, 7, and \n8. Again, common practice dictates that we say that starting time of A2 is 5 (which \nis the ending time of A1) and the ending time is 8. In other words, the interval 0 to \n1 is day 1, the interval 1 to 2 is day 2, the interval 2 to 3 is day 3, etc. Continuing \nin this way, A3 is scheduled on M4 from day 8 to day 15; and A4 is scheduled on \nM2 from day 15 to day 19. The job A is finished in 19 days which is called the \ncompletion time of job A or the flow time of job A. It may be noted that the total \ntime of all operations of job A, time of A1 + time of A2 + time of A3 + time of \nA4 = 5 + 3 + 7 + 4 = 19. In this case, the flow time of job A is 19 days. However, \nin general, the flow time of a job is not equal to the sum of processing times of its \noperations because a job might have to wait for its turn to be processed. See the flow \ntimes of jobs B and C below.\nSchedule of Job B: The first operation of job B, B1, starts on machine M2 at time \nzero and is finished on time 2 (days 1 and 2). The machine required for operation \nB2 is M3. The operation B2 can start on M3 as soon as B1 is completed. However, \nB2 takes 6 days. If we schedule B2 starting at time 2, the operation A2, sched -\nuled to start on day 6 will have to be pushed forward. However, we have made \nan assumption that preemption is not allowed which means that A2 cannot be \nrescheduled\u2014pushed forward. So B2 will have to wait and start after A2 has been \ncompleted on day 8. Proceeding in this way, B3 is completed on day 23. The flow \ntime of job B is 23. The total time for job B is time for B1 + time for B2 + time for \nB3 = 2 + 6 + 8 = 16. However, the flow time of job B is 23 because job B had to \nwait for its turn to be processed. It waited on days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (6 days) on M3 \nwhen A2 was being processed and on day 15 on M4 when A3 was processed. The \ntotal wait-in-time of job B is 7 days. The total processing time is 16 days. Therefore, \nthe flow time is 23 days (total job time + total wait-in-time).\nSchedule of job C : Using the process described above for jobs A and B, the \nstart and end times of all operations of job C can be determined.

By recording conditions over time, it is possible to measure rates of \nchange which are also important systems descriptors. Timing is critical to \nthe performance of orchestras, sports teams, and business organizations.

Coordination of all participants \nis essential.

To operate a process properly, it is necessary for all \nparticipants to have the systems perspective. In particular, the attainment of \nquality calls for a dedicated team effort. A mistake by anyone involved in the \nattainment of quality is like the weak link of a chain, which causes the whole \nsystem to fail.

The operating capacity cannot be more than the designed capacity. The \nactual utilization of the four tellers may only be (say) 27 h\u2014based on the number \nof customers that visit the bank.\nThe same situation applies to grocery stores with one cash register and super -\nmarkets with dozens of checkout counters. The number of operating rooms in a \nhospital is the maximum design capacity. The number of seats in a restaurant is the \nmaximum design capacity but the service rate and the length of time that custom -\ners stay in their seats determines throughput capacity.\nIn that regard, maximum operational capacity can also be defined as maxi -\nmum sustained throughput of goods or services. Operations capacity describes how \nmany units can be supplied per unit of time. For services, a bank might compare \nthe maximum number of people the bank teller can process per hour with the \nmaximum number of people the ATM can process per hour. This is a supply chain \nservice capacity comparison.\nFor a manufacturing supply chain example, compare the maximum number of \nhot dogs Oscar Meyer (OM) can make and ship per hour with the maximum num-\nber of hot dogs Hebrew National (HN) can make and ship per hour.

In the following sections, we will discuss capacity planning for an \noperational department what is popularly known as aggregate production planning.\n4.2 Introduction to Aggregate Production Planning\nAggregate planning (AP) moves the focus onto the shop floor, inside a manufactur-\ning plant, or in a service facility, where work is done. Operations managers must \ndeal with workforce planning. The number of employees is strongly related to the \noutputs required from the input\u2013output transformation process. Workforce plan -\nning is directly related to the control of inventories based on forecasts of demand.\nAP is the process to develop a generalized production plan for all job types in an \norganization. For example, the job types may include: the water-based, oil-based, \nand acrylic paints for a paint manufacturer; different kinds of services offered by a \nmarket research company; or a hospital with tests and treatments for all kinds of",

Any entry on the activity \nreport or log requiring more than one entry is added to the next available \nline until the record is complete. These logs are usually completed by the \nresponsibility center manager and given to the quality organization for \nposting in the performance log.\nP O sting\nThe process by which the outputs and nonconformance are summarized \nand transferred to activities on the performance log is called posting. It \nconsists of transferring totals for the outputs (total) column and the non -\nconformance (nc) column on the individual activity reports or logs to the \nperformance log. This is usually performed once a month by the quality \norganization.\nIn most businesses, the posting is done either manually or by data-\n \nprocessing methods. The conversion to paperless information systems \nhas become very common among businesses.

Sometime the vendors give price discounts for buying-in large quantities. \nThat leads to purchases in large quantities which increases inventories.\nSince it is essential to keep inventories for the smooth and efficient operations \nof an organization, the question is not, \u201cwhether to keep inventories or not to keep \ninventories\u201d but the question is, \u201chow much inventory should be kept?\u201d We propose \nto answer this question in this chapter. Inventory is a necessary evil which cannot \nbe eliminated completely and at the same time large levels of inventories may prove \ndisastrous for a company. Surplus inventory may become the graveyard of business \nand a major factor contributing to the business failure. Inventory plays a crucial role \nin the efficient and smooth operation of an organization. It decouples the various \nstages of a business system.\nThis chapter explains how to manage inventories of materials that have con -\ntinuous demand. This class of inventory models is known by the acronym OPP \n(order point policies). These materials are independent, which means they are not \ncomponents of a high variety of finished goods. The two basic models include the \neconomic order quantity (EOQ) model that is designed for buying items to satisfy \nreplenishment requirements of continuous demand items and the economic pro -\nduction quantity (EPQ) model that is designed for determining the batch (also \ncalled lot) sizes in which an item will be produced. This model is also known as \neconomic batch size or economic lot size (ELS) model. We will use the terms EPQ \nand ELS interchangeably in this chapter.\nThese concepts are fundamental to understanding how perpetual and periodic \ninventory systems work and when each is preferred. Quantity discount models (not \ndiscussed in this chapter) are a byproduct of the EOQ model, providing further \ninsights for inventory managers in situations where discounts are offered to buy-in \nlarge quantities.\nWithout the systems perspective, everyone, everywhere will be ordering what \nthey need as they need it. Lack of coordination diminishes buying power and \nloses the knowledge-based benefits of the centralized system. Strategic thinking is \nrequired to optimize the production plans of suppliers and producers to best meet \nthe needs of their customers throughout the supply chain. In that way, the lowest \ncosts and best deliveries can be achieved for mutual benefit. The information system \nof a multinational company with a centralized inventory management system has to \nkeep track globally of where everything is, where and when it will be needed, when \nto re-order it, and where to store it. It is an enormous system to manage. The strategic \nthinking that went into designing any such system must be robust and not casual. \nThe need for re-planning is always there when things do not work out as planned.\n5.2 Types of Inventory Situations\nInventory is those stocks or items used to support production (raw materials and \nwork in process items), supporting activities (maintenance, repair, and operating",

For example, if the beginning inventory for the exam-\nple discussed above was 100 units, then the demand in the first month will be reduced \nto 300 (= 400 \u2212 100) because the 100 units in stock can be used to meet the demand \nof the first month. We assumed a beginning inventory of zero in the above example.\nThe existing production level affects the cost of changing the production level \n(up or down) in the first month. In the example above, we assumed the existing pro-\nduction level per day to be 21 units. Therefore, we had to increase the production \nlevel by 2.33 (= 23.33 \u2212 21) in the Level plan. The production level was decreased \nby 2.82 (= 21 \u2212 18.18) in the Chase plan, increased by 2.04 ( = 23.04 \u2212 21) in the \nHybrid plan, and decreased by 4.33 (= 21 \u2212 16.67) in the Level plan with overtime.\n4.5  Example 3: Aggregate Production Planning in a \nService Industry\nThis example is built around Example 2 with the purpose of illustrating some of \nthe differences that distinguish AP for making goods from providing services. The \nhealthcare service sector is very large and growing. It requires a great deal of testing \nfor diagnostic reasons. A blood-testing laboratory provides a good illustration of \na service system with testing capacity that cannot be fully used when there is not \nenough demand. Technicians\u2019 time cannot be stored when technicians are idle. On \nthe other hand, when demand is greater than the technical capacity to supply tests, \nthe tests must be postponed or subcontracted or done on overtime. The big differ -\nence with the manufacturer\u2019s example is the inability to create a useful inventory \nwhen capacity to test is greater than demand for testing. That point will now be \nillustrated by Example 3 using the data in Table 4.13.\nThis table gives the expected demand for blood tests in a laboratory. Blood tests \nare the product of the lab. Because all tests are individual and unique, they can only \nbe made on demand. Demand for tests of different kinds are aggregated\u2014some \ntake longer than others and use different kinds of materials and equipment. The \naggregation is based on averaging across the normal mix of blood test procedures. \nDemand, in this example, is stated in units (occasionally as test kit units).\nWe repeat that this service case and the prior manufacturing case use the same \nset of numbers for demand levels, production capacity, and applicable costs applied \nto different strategies for matching supply and demand. The difference to note is \nthat the manufacturer can store units in inventory to meet later demand but the \nblood-testing laboratory cannot.\nTable 4.13 provides the number of working days for each month over a 12-month \nplanning horizon. The total yearly demand is 5856 blood tests with an average of \n488 testing units per month. The demand varies from a high of 650 test kit units in \nAugust to a low of 350 units in October.

The total risk is the sum \nof the products of the consequences multiplied by their probabilities. The \nspectrums of risks across classes of events are also of concern, and are \nusually controlled in licensing processes (it would be of concern if rare but \nhigh-consequence events were found to dominate the overall risk).\nProbabilistic risk assessment usually answers three basic questions:\nWhat can go wrong with the studied technological entity, or what are \nthe initiators or initiating events (undesirable starting events) that \nlead to adverse consequence(s)?\nWhat and how severe are the potential detriments or the adverse con -\nsequences that the technological entity may be eventually subjected \nto as a result of the occurrence of the initiator?\nHow likely to occur are these undesirable consequences, or what are \ntheir probabilities or frequencies?\nTwo common methods of answering this last question are event tree \n \nanalysis and fault tree analysis\u2014for explanations of these, see safety \n \nengineering.\nIn addition to the above methods, PRA studies require special but often \nvery important analysis tools like human reliability analysis (HRA) and \ncommon cause or failure (CCF) analysis. HRA deals with methods for \nmodeling human error, while CCF analysis deals with methods for evalu -\nating the effect of intersystem and intrasystem dependencies which tend \nto\n \ncause simultaneous failures and thus significant increases in overall \nrisk.\nPRA studies have been successfully performed for complex techno -\nlogical systems at all phases of the life cycle from concept definition and \n \npredesign through safe removal from operation. For example, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission (NRC) required that each nuclear power plant in \nthe United States perform an individual plant examination (IPE) to \n \nidentify \nand quantify plant vulnerabilities to hardware failures and human faults in \ndesign and operation. Although no method was \n \nspecified for \n \nperforming \nsuch an evaluation, the NRC requires risk analysis (Business).\nRisk analysis is a technique to identify and assess factors that may jeop -\nardize the success of a project or the achievement of a goal.
