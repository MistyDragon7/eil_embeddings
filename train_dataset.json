In simpler times, \nwhen goods and services were provided by individual artisans, elaborate \nquality systems were unnecessary. An individual producer could simply \ncompare customer requirements to his or her work and estimate its value.\nThe rise of complex and large enterprises produced the need for the \ndevelopment of objective and equitable quality procedures for the deter -\nmination of value so the owners could assure the efficiency of their opera-\ntions. Traditional quality management concerned itself with \n \ndeveloping \nprocedures to determine product conformance or nonconformance \n(inspection).\nUnfortunately, in too many cases, the study of (inspection) proce -\ndures became an end in itself. Businesses lost sight of the objectives of \nthe \n \nprocedures. \u201cAcceptable\u201d techniques were applied whether they were \nappropriate or not. This in turn led to criticism of quality management \nas a \n \ndiscipline that provided a great deal of largely irrelevant data to \nmanagement.\nFortunately, the discipline is changing. Quality professionals are becom-\ning much more concerned with providing information that will help \nmanagement meet the firm\u2019s goals. In this book, I hope to continue the \nmovement toward consideration of the objectives of quality management \nand value reporting.\nIn quality management, fairness and objectivity play an almost equal \nrole with relevance in the determination of the appropriate quality pro -\ncedures. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specifies \nactivities that must be followed as generally accepted quality principles \nand practices (GAQP) known as ISO 9000. In some cases, the opinions \nof groups with regard to these practices are backed only by the accepted \nstature of the promulgating organizations, whereas in others, the imposed \nrequirements carry the weight of law behind them. In nearly every case, \nthe intent of the suggested (or required) practice is to promote fairness in \nquality and the reporting of quality performance information to a diverse \nmanagement audience.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

In effect, three people \nworking together can do more work than ten people working separately. \nAnother benefit of organizing the business is more efficient communica -\ntion and reduced conflict by ensuring that authority and responsibility \ncoincide.\nc ateg O rizing d uties\nOrganizing can be viewed as categorizing activities in a business by some \nmeaningful attributes. In most cases, business activities can be categorized \ninto leadership, product or service producing , and support. A category is a \nresponsibility center with an activity or collection of activities controlled \nby a single individual. In the quality organization and planning process, \nobjectives are proposed for each responsibility center. The responsibility \ncenter then becomes the focal point for planning and control.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

This includes establishing policies, \ngoals, objectives, and standards. This group has authority and responsi -\nbility throughout the organization, from the overall system down to its \nindividual processes. In general, the highest level of leadership (execu -\ntive management) in the company is responsible for the overall direction \n(objectives) of the business. Individual process leaders (departmental \nmanagers) in turn are responsible for the procedures needed to achieve \na given objective. Each individual with decision-making authority in an \norganization has responsibility for some aspect of achieving the compa -\nny\u2019s objectives. It is essential to recognize this through the development \nof the quality management system. That is, the focus of the performance-\nreporting system is on responsibility centers.\nProduct or \ns\nervice Producing\nA product- or service-producing center (see Figure\n \n1.1) is also called a \nproduct realization center if the person responsible has authority for pro -\nducing or providing products or services to the customer.\nThe product- or service-producing category contains those individuals \nwho are directly engaged in providing an output to the customer. This \nencompasses sales, engineering, and production activities. Ironically, the \nperceived order of importance of these activities is in reverse order. That is, \nproduction activities are the most visible, whereas engineering and sales \nare indirectly perceived as impacting the overall output.

The main component of these clas -\nsifications revolves around the principle of the span of control. This refers \nto the number of subordinates a manager can effectively manage. The \nnumber of people who should report directly to any one person should be \nbased upon the complexity, variety, and proximity of the work.\nIn practice, this turns out to be a ratio of 1:5 or 1:7. Therefore, every \nfive to seven workers would report to a lead person; in turn, five to seven \nleads would report to a supervisor (5 n); and so on. This would mean that \na supervisor would be able to effectively manage twenty-five workers; a \nmanager could lead 125, and a director 625 in each department or group. \nThe higher levels of management (directors and managers) should be \nspending the majority of their time organizing and planning the activi -\nties in their respective departments, while the lower levels of manage -\nment (leads and supervisors) are predominantly involved in worker \nmotivation and control.

These activities are critical for \nthe survival of the organization, where nonconformities have an immedi -\nate impact on cash flow. Some of these activities are revenue centers, while \nothers are cost centers. The objective should be established to maximize \nrevenue and/or reduce (or control) cost.\nIn Table\n \n2.3, sales would be a revenue center (we take money in), where we \nwould try to establish a realistic maximum goal or objective. Purchasing, \non the other hand, is a cost center ( we pay money out ), where we would \nwant to establish a realistic minimum (or control) goal or objective. It is \nsenior management\u2019s responsibility to find the optimum balance between \nrevenue, cost, and expected market share while setting objectives. There \nis always a cost associated with operating a business, and it is unrealistic \nto assume there isn\u2019t. Therefore, fixed costs based upon functional area \nthroughput should always be considered a normal part of the process.\nThe very nature of the strategy- and goal-setting process is dynamic \nand interactive.

Therefore, an event that affects any of the elements in the value \nequation (outputs or nonconformance) must be logged.\na ctivity r e PO rting\nThe ultimate objective of performance logging is to record the correct \nnumber of outputs generated by an activity and the amount of non -\nconformance. However, for practical reasons there is a very important \nquality-logging function, preceding the recording of outputs and non -\nconformance. The outputs and nonconformance are first entered in a pre-\nliminary record called an activity report or log. The process of recording \noutputs and nonconformance is called journalizing. After the outputs and \nnonconformance have been journalized, they are totaled and posted to the \nperformance report or log.\nSome of the reasons for activity reporting or logging are as follows:\n \n1.\n \nIt provides a chronological record of all outputs and nonconfor -\nmance generated by an activity.\n \n2.\n \nIt fulfills the need for recording in one place all outputs and noncon-\nformance for a responsibility center.\n \n3.\n \nIt provides more information, such as a detailed explanation of \nnonconformance, than can conveniently be recorded on individual \nrecords.\nThe original sources of information concerning most outputs and non -\nconformance are quality records. Examples are sales orders, purchasing \ndocuments, production logs, and various other types of business papers. \nSuch records are called source documents . Information obtained from \nsource documents helps in determining the number of outputs generated \nand amount of nonconformance found. The source documents also pro -\nvide valuable evidence to support the accuracy of the performance log.\nThe purpose of the activity report or log is to provide a chronological \nrecord of all outputs and nonconformance for a given quality activity.

The analysis is designed to allow improved decision making by allow-\ning more complete consideration of outcomes and their implications.\nFor example, in economics and finance, a financial institution might \nattempt to forecast several possible scenarios for the economy (e.g., rapid \ngrowth, moderate growth, and slow growth), and it might also attempt \nto forecast financial market returns (for bonds, stocks, and cash) in each \nof those scenarios. The institution might consider subsets of each of the \npossibilities. It might further seek to determine correlations and assign \nprobabilities to the scenarios (and subsets, if any). Then it will be in a \nposition to consider how to distribute assets between asset types (i.e., \nasset \n \nallocation); the institution can also calculate the scenario-weighted \nexpected return (this figure will indicate the overall attractiveness of the \nfinancial environment).\nDepending on the complexity of the financial environment, economic \nand finance scenario analysis can be a demanding exercise.

The outcomes can be mod -\neled mathematically and statistically (e.g., taking account of possible vari-\nability within single scenarios as well as possible relationships between \nscenarios).\nFinancial institutions can take the analysis further by relating the asset \nallocation that the above calculations suggest to the industry or peer group \ndistribution of assets. In so doing, the financial institution seeks to control \nits business risk rather than the client\u2019s portfolio risk.\nIn politics or geopolitics, scenario analysis involves modeling the pos -\nsible alternative paths of a social or political environment, and possi -\nbly diplomatic and war risks. For example, in the recent Iraq War, the \nPentagon certainly had to model alternative possibilities that might arise \nin the war situation and had to position material and troops accordingly. \nThe difficulty of such forecasting is highlighted in that case by the fact \nthat it is arguable that the Pentagon failed to foresee the lawlessness and \n \ninsecurity of the postwar situation and the level of hostility shown toward \nthe \n \noccupying forces.\nScenario analysis can also be used to illuminate \u201cwild cards.\u201d For exam-\nple, analysis of the possibility of the earth being struck by a large celestial \nobject (a meteor) suggests that while the probability is low, the damage \ninflicted would be so high that the event is much more important (threat-\nening) than the low probability (in any one year) alone would suggest. \nHowever, this possibility is usually disregarded by organizations using \nscenario analysis to develop a strategic plan, since it has such overarch -\ning repercussions. In the case of personnel planning (see Table\n \n4.1), the \namount of additional resources that are needed can be estimated based \nupon the current staffing level and projected increase or decrease on the \noutput of each process. Additionally, the required management staff can \nbe estimated based upon the 1:5 to 1:7 ratio discussed in Chapter 1.\nFrom Table\n \n4.1, the current staffing and projected staffing calculated \nbased upon expected process output increase at some future period in \ntime.

In job analysis con -\nducted by HR professionals, it is common to use more than one of these \nmethods.\nFor example, the job analysts may tour the job site and observe work -\ners performing their jobs. During the tour, the analyst may collect mate -\nrials that directly or indirectly indicate required skills (duty statements, \ninstructions, safety manuals, quality charts, etc.).\nThe analyst may then meet with a group of workers or incumbents. And, \nfinally, a survey may be administered. In these cases, job analysts typically \nare industrial psychologists or have been trained by, and are acting under \nthe supervision of, an industrial psychologist.\nIn the context of vocational rehabilitation, the primary method is \ndirect observation and may even include video recordings of incum -\nbents involved in the work. It is common for such job analysts to use \nscales and\n \nother apparatus to collect precise measures of the amount of \nstrength or force required for various tasks. Accurate, factual evidence \nof the degree of strength required for job performance is needed to \njustify that a disabled worker is legitimately qualified for disability \n \nstatus. \nIn the United States, billions of dollars are paid to disabled workers \nby private insurers and the federal government (primarily through the \nSocial Security Administration). Disability determination is, therefore, \noften a fairly \u201chigh-stakes\u201d decision. Job analysts in these contexts typi -\ncally come from a health occupation such as occupational or physical \ntherapy.\nQuestionnaires are the most common methodology employed by certi -\nfication test developers, although the content of the questionnaires (often \nlists of tasks that might be performed) is gathered through interviews or \nfocus groups. Job analysts in this area typically operate under the supervi-\nsion of a psychologist.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Hersey and Blanchard (1982) use \nthis approach: they claim that management merely consists of leader -\nship applied to business situations, or in other words, management \nforms a \n \nsubset of the broader process of \n \nleadership. They put it this \nway: \u201cLeadership occurs any time one attempts to influence the behav -\nior of an individual or group, regardless of the reason. Management is \na kind of leadership in which the achievement of organizational goals is  \nparamount.\u201d\nHowever, a clear distinction between management and leadership may \nnevertheless prove useful. This would allow for a reciprocal \n \nrelationship \nbetween leadership and management, implying that an effective \n \nmanager \nshould possess leadership skills, and an effective leader should \n \ndemonstrate \nmanagement skills. One clear distinction could provide the following \ndefinition:\n \n1.\n \nManagement involves power by position.\n \n2.\n \nLeadership involves power by influence.\nAbraham Zaleznik (1977), for example, delineated differences between \nleadership and management. He saw leaders as inspiring visionaries \n \nconcerned about substance, while viewing managers as planners who \nhave concerns with process. Warren Bennis (1989) further explicated a \ndichotomy between managers and leaders. He drew twelve distinctions \nbetween the two groups:\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

He observes that, as a broad generalization, managers concern \nthemselves with tasks, while leaders concern themselves with people. Birch \ndoes not suggest that leaders do not focus on \u201cthe task.\u201d Indeed, the things \nthat characterize a great leader include the fact that they achieve. Effective \nleaders create and sustain competitive advantage through the attainment \nof cost leadership, revenue leadership, time leadership, and market value \nleadership. Managers typically follow and realize a leader\u2019s vision. The dif-\nference lies in the leader realizing that the achievement of the task comes \nabout through the goodwill and support of others (\n \ninfluence), while the \nmanager may not.\nThis goodwill and support originate in the leader seeing people as \n \npeople, not as another resource for deployment in support of \u201cthe task.\u201d \nThe manager often has the role of organizing resources to get something \ndone. People form one of these resources, and many of the worst \n \nmanagers \ntreat people as just another interchangeable item. A leader has the role of \nmotivating others to follow a path he or she has laid out, or a vision he or \nshe has articulated in order to achieve a task. Often, people see the task as \nsubordinate to the vision. For instance, an organization might have the \noverall task of generating profit, but good leaders may see profit as a by-\nproduct that flows from whatever aspect of their vision that differentiates \ntheir company from the competition.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Many people can think of an inspiring leader they have encountered \nwho has nothing whatever to do with business: a politician, an officer in \nthe armed forces, a Scout or Guide leader, a teacher, and so on. Similarly, \n \nmanagement does not occur only in the context of business. Again, we can \nthink of examples of people who we have met who fill the \n \nmanagement \nniche in nonbusiness organizations. Nonbusiness organizations should \nfind it easier to articulate a non-money-driven inspiring vision that will \nsupport true leadership. However, often this does not occur.\nDifferences in the mix of leadership and management can define various \nmanagement styles. Some management styles tend to deemphasize leader-\nship. Included in this group, one could include participatory \n \nmanagement, \ndemocratic management, and collaborative management styles. Other \nmanagement styles, such as authoritarian management, micromanage -\nment, and top-down management, depend more on a leader to \n \nprovide \ndirection. Note, however, that just because an organization has no \n \nsingle \nleader giving it direction, this does not mean it necessarily has weak \nleadership. In many cases, group leadership (multiple leaders) can prove \neffective. Having a single leader (as in a dictatorship) allows for quick and \ndecisive decision making when needed, as well as when not needed. Group \ndecision making sometimes earns the derisive label committee-itis because \nof the longer times required to make decisions, but group leadership can \nbring more expertise, experience, and perspectives through a democratic \nprocess.\nPatricia Pitcher (1994) has challenged the division into leaders and man-\nagers. She used a factor analysis (in marketing) technique on data \n \ncollected \nover eight years and concluded that three types of leaders exist, each with \nvery different psychological profiles: artists were imaginative, inspiring, \nvisionary, entrepreneurial, intuitive, daring, and emotional; craftsmen \nwere well-balanced, steady, reasonable, sensible, predictable, and trust -\nworthy; and technocrats were cerebral, detail-oriented, fastidious, uncom-\npromising, and hard-headed. She speculates that no one \n \nprofile offers a \npreferred leadership style. She claims that if we want to build, we should \nfind an \u201cartist leader\u201d; if we want to solidify our position, we should find a \n\u201ccraftsman leader\u201d; and if we have an ugly job that needs to get done like \ndownsizing, we should find a \u201ctechnocratic leader.\u201d Pitcher also observes \nthat a balanced leader exhibiting all three sets of traits occurs extremely \nrarely: she found none in her study.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

He argues \nthat \n \nsuccessful executives need to apply both disciplines in a balance \nappropriate to the enterprise and its context.

The communication involved with this method is mainly \ndownward, from the leader to the subordinate. Critics such as Elton Mayo \nhave argued that this method can lead to a decrease in motivation from \nthe employee\u2019s point of view. The main advantage of this style is that the \ndirection of the business will remain constant, and the decisions will all \nbe similar; this in turn can project an image of a confident, well-managed \nbusiness. On the other hand, subordinates may become highly dependent \nupon the leaders and increased supervision may be needed.\nPaternalistic\nA more paternalistic form is also essentially dictatorial; however, the deci-\nsions tend to be in the best interests of the employees rather than the busi-\nness. A good example of this would be David Brent running the business \nin the British version of the fictional television show The Office.

This can help balance out the lack of \nworker motivation caused by an autocratic management style.

If the wrong decisions are made, \nthen all employees may become dissatisfied with the leader.\nDemocratic\nIn a democratic style, the manager allows the employees to take part in deci-\nsion making; therefore, everything is agreed on by the majority. The com-\nmunication is extensive in both directions (from subordinates to leaders \nand vice versa). This style can be particularly useful when complex decisions \nneed to be made that require a range of specialist skills: for example, when \na new information and communication technologies (ICT) system needs \nto be put in place and the upper management of the business is computer \nilliterate. From the overall business\u2019 point of view, job satisfaction and qual-\nity of work will improve. However, the decision-making process is severely \nslowed down, and the need for a consensus may lead to not taking the \u201cbest\u201d \ndecision for the business. It can go against a better choice of action.\nLaissez-Faire\nIn a laissez-faire leadership style, the leader\u2019s role is peripheral and staff man-\nages their own areas of the business; the leader therefore evades the duties of \nmanagement, and uncoordinated delegation occurs. The communication in \nthis style is horizontal, meaning that it is equal in both directions; however, \nvery little communication occurs in comparison with other styles. The style \nbrings out the best in highly professional and creative groups of employees; \nhowever, in many cases it is not deliberate and is simply a result of poor \nmanagement.

Some people include shelter as a primary \nreward. Secondary rewards derive their value from the primary rewards \nand include money, pleasant touch, beautiful faces, music, and the like. \nThe functions of rewards are based directly on the modification of behav -\nior and less directly on the physical and sensory properties of rewards.

In some \ncompanies, employees receive assessments from their manager, peers, sub-\nordinates, and customers while also performing a self-assessment.\nThe most popular methods that are being used as performance appraisal \nprocesses are as follows:\n \n1.\n \nManagement by objectives (MBO)\n \n2.\n \nBehavioral Observation Scale (BOS)\n \n3.\n \nBehaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS)\nTrait-based systems, which rely on factors such as integrity and consci -\nentiousness, are also commonly used by businesses. The scientific litera -\nture on the subject provides evidence that assessing employees on factors \nsuch as these should be avoided. The reasons for this are twofold:\n \n1.\n \nBecause trait-based systems are by definition based on personality \ntraits, they make it difficult for a manager to provide feedback that can \ncause positive change in employee performance. This is caused by the \nfact that personality dimensions are for the most part static, and while \nan employee can change a specific behavior, he cannot change his per-\nsonality. For example, a person who lacks integrity may stop lying to \na manager because she has been caught, but she still has low integrity \nand is likely to lie again when the threat of being caught is gone.\n \n2.\n \nTrait-based systems, because they are vague, are more easily influenced \nby office politics, causing them to be less reliable as a source of infor-\nmation on an employee\u2019s true performance. The vagueness of these \ninstruments allows managers to fill them out based on who they want \nto give a raise to, or feel should get a raise, rather than basing scores \non specific behaviors that employees should or should not be engag-\ning in. These systems are also more likely to leave a company open to \ndiscrimination claims because a manager can make biased decisions \nwithout having to back them up with specific behavioral information.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

It is applicable to a \nwide variety of academic disciplines, from the natural and social sciences \nto the humanities, and to government and business.\nStatistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection \nof data; this is called descriptive statistics. In addition, patterns in the data \nmay be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty \nin the observations, and then used to draw inferences about the process or \npopulation being studied; this is called inferential statistics. Both descrip-\ntive and inferential statistics comprise applied statistics. There is also \na\n \ndiscipline called mathematical statistics , which is concerned with the \ntheoretical basis of the subject.\nThe word statistics is also the plural of statistic (singular), which refers to \nthe result of applying a statistical algorithm to a set of data, as in economic \nstatistics, crime statistics, and so on.\nh\nistory\nSome scholars pinpoint the origin of statistics to 1662, with the publication \nof \u201cObservations on the Bills of Mortality\u201d by John Graunt.

Today, statistics is widely employed in gov-\nernment, business, and the natural and social sciences.\nBecause of its empirical roots and its applications, statistics is generally \nconsidered not to be a subfield of pure mathematics, but rather a distinct \nbranch of applied mathematics. Its mathematical foundations were laid \nin the seventeenth century with the development of probability theory \nby Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. Probability theory arose from the \nstudy of games of chance. The method of least squares was first described \nby Carl Friedrich Gauss around 1794. The use of modern computers has \nexpedited large-scale statistical computation, and has also made possible \nnew methods that are impractical to perform manually.\nOverview\nIn applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, \none begins with a process or population to be studied. This might be a \n \npopulation of people in a country, of crystal grains in a rock, or of goods \nmanufactured by a particular factory during a given period. It may instead \nbe a process observed at various times; data collected about this kind of \n\u201cpopulation\u201d constitute what is called a time series.\nFor practical reasons, rather than compiling data about an entire pop -\nulation, one usually studies a chosen subset of the population, called a \nsample. Data are collected about the sample in an observational or experi-\nmental setting. The data are then subjected to statistical analysis, which \nserves two related purposes: description and inference.\nDescriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data, either numeri-\ncally or graphically, to describe the sample. Basic examples of numerical \ndescriptors include the mean and standard deviation. Graphical summa -\nrizations include various kinds of charts and graphs.\nInferential statistics is used to model patterns in the data, accounting for \nrandomness and drawing inferences about the larger population. These \ninferences may take the form of answers to yes/no questions (hypothesis \ntesting), estimates of numerical characteristics (estimation), descriptions \nof association (correlation), or modeling of relationships (regression). \nOther modeling techniques include analysis of variance (ANOV A), time \nseries, and data mining.\nThe concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy. Statistical \n \nanalysis \nof a data set may reveal that two variables (that is, two properties of the \n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

For example, a study of annual income and age of death among \npeople might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than \n \naffluent \npeople. The two variables are said to be correlated (which is a positive \ncorrelation in this case). However, one cannot immediately infer the exis-\ntence of a causal relationship between the two variables. The \n \ncorrelated \nphenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenom-\nenon, called a lurking variable or confounding variable.\nIf the sample is representative of the population, then inferences and \nconclusions made from the sample can be extended to the population as a \nwhole. A major problem lies in determining the extent to which the cho -\nsen sample is representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and cor-\nrect for randomness in the sample and in the data collection procedure, \nas well as methods for designing robust experiments in the first place. \nThe fundamental mathematical concept employed in understanding such \nrandomness is probability. Mathematical statistics (also called statistical \ntheory) is the branch of applied mathematics that uses probability theory \nand analysis to examine the theoretical basis of statistics.\nThe use of any statistical method is valid only when the system or popu-\nlation under consideration satisfies the basic mathematical assumptions \nof the method. Misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors \nin description and interpretation\u2014subtle in the sense that even experi -\nenced professionals sometimes make such errors, and serious in the sense \nthat they may affect, for instance, social policy, medical practice, and the \nreliability of structures such as bridges. Even when statistics is correctly \napplied, the results can be difficult for the nonexpert to interpret. For \nexample, the statistical significance of a trend in the data, which measures \nthe extent to which the trend could be caused by random variation in the \nsample, may not agree with one\u2019s intuitive sense of its significance. The set \nof basic statistical skills (and skepticism) needed by people to deal with \ninformation in their everyday lives is referred to as statistical literacy.\ns\ntatistical \nm\nethods\nExperimental and Observational Studies\nA common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causal -\nity, and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the \n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

There are two major types of causal statistical studies, experi -\nmental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the \neffects of \n \ndifferences of an independent variable (or variables) on the \nbehavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between \nthe two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be \nvery effective.\nAn experimental study involves taking measurements of the \n \nsystem under \nstudy, manipulating the system, and then taking additional \n \nmeasurements \nusing the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified \nthe values of the measurements. In contrast, an \n \nobservational study does \nnot involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered and \ncorrelations between predictors and response are investigated.\nAn example of an experimental study is the famous Hawthorne studies, \nwhich attempted to test the changes to the working environment at the \nHawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company. The researchers were \ninterested in determining whether increased illumination would increase \nthe productivity of the assembly line workers. The researchers first mea -\nsured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an \narea of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected the \nproductivity. It turned out that the productivity indeed improved (under \nthe experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized \ntoday for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a \ncontrol group and blindedness.\nAn example of an observational study is a study which explores the \n \ncorrelation between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically \nuses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest, and then \nperforms statistical analysis of the observational data. In this case, the \nresearchers would \n \ncollect observations of both smokers and nonsmokers, \nperhaps through a \n \ncase-control study, and then look for the number of \ncases of lung cancer in each group.\nThe basic steps of an experiment are as follows:\nPlanning the research, including determining information sources, \u2022\t\nresearch subject selection, and ethical considerations for the \nproposed research and method\nDesigning experiments, concentrating on the system model and the \u2022\t\ninteraction of independent and dependent variables\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

They have \ndifferent degrees of usefulness in statistical research. Ratio measurements \nhave both a zero value and the distances between different measurements \ndefined; they provide the greatest flexibility in statistical methods that can \nbe used for analyzing the data. Interval measurements have meaningful dis-\ntances between measurements defined, but have no meaningful zero value \n(as in the case with IQ measurements or with temperature measurements \nin Fahrenheit). Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between \nconsecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values. Nominal \nmeasurements have no meaningful rank order among values.\nSince variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements \ncannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are referred \nto as categorical variables, whereas ratio and interval measurements are \ngrouped together as quantitative or continuous variables due to their \nnumerical nature.\nStatistical process control (SPC) is an effective method of monitoring a \nprocess through the use of control charts. Control charts enable the use of \nobjective criteria for distinguishing background variation from events of \nsignificance based on statistical techniques. Much of SPC\u2019s power lies in \nthe ability to monitor both the process center and its variation about that \ncenter. By collecting data from samples at various points within the pro -\ncess, variations in the process that may affect the quality of the end product \nor service can be detected and corrected, thus reducing waste as well as \nthe likelihood that problems will be passed on to the customer. With its \nemphasis on early detection and prevention of problems, SPC has a distinct \nadvantage over quality methods such as inspection, that apply resources to \ndetecting and correcting problems in the end product or service.\nIn addition to reducing waste, SPC can lead to a reduction in the time \nrequired to produce the product or provide the service from end to end. \n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Shewhart in the \nearly 1920s. W. Edwards Deming later applied SPC methods in the United \nStates during World War II, thereby successfully improving quality in the \nmanufacture of munitions and other strategically important products. \nDeming was also instrumental in introducing SPC methods to Japanese \nindustry after the war had ended.\nShewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of  \na state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments. While  \nDr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he \nunderstood that data from physical processes seldom produce a normal \ndistribution curve  (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly referred to \nas a bell curve ). He discovered that observed variation in manufactur -\ning data did not always behave the same way as with data in nature (for \nexample, Brownian motion of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that \nwhile every process displays variation, some processes display controlled \nvariation that is natural to the process (common causes of variation), \nwhile others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the pro -\ncess causal system at all times (special causes of variation).\ng\neneral\nThe following description relates to manufacturing rather than to the ser-\nvice industry, although the principles of SPC can be successfully applied \nto either. SPC has also been successfully applied to detecting changes in \norganizational behavior, with social network change detection introduced \nby McCulloh (2007).\nIn mass manufacturing, the quality of the finished article was tradi -\ntionally achieved through postmanufacturing inspection of the product, \naccepting or rejecting each article (or samples from a production lot) based \n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

In contrast, SPC uses statisti -\ncal tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to \npredict significant deviations that may later result in rejected product.\nTwo kinds of variations occur in all manufacturing processes; both \nthese process variations cause subsequent variations in the final product: \nThe first are known as natural or common causes of variation and may \nbe variations in temperature, specifications of raw materials or electrical \ncurrent, and so on. These variations are small, and are generally near to \nthe average value. The pattern of variation will be similar to those found \nin nature, and the distribution forms the bell-shaped normal distribution \ncurve (see Figure\n \n6.1). The second kind is known as special causes , and \nhappens less frequently than the first.\nFor example, a breakfast cereal\u2013packaging line may be designed to \nfill each cereal box with 500 grams of product, but some boxes will have \nslightly more than 500 grams, and some will have slightly less, in accor -\ndance with a distribution of net weights. If the production process, its \ninputs, or its environment changes (for example, the machines doing the \nmanufacture begin to wear), this distribution can change. For example, \nas\n \nits cams and pulleys wear out, the cereal-filling machine may start put -\nting more cereal into each box than specified. If this change is allowed \nto continue unchecked, more and more product will be produced that \nfalls outside the tolerances of the manufacturer or consumer, resulting in \nwaste. While in this case, the waste is in the form of \u201cfree\u201d product for the \nconsumer, typically waste consists of rework or scrap.\nSeries 1\n\u20133s \u20132s \u20131s X 1 s 2 s 3 s\n0.3\n0.25\n0.15\n0.05\n0.2\n0.1\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21\n68.26%\n95.46%\n99.73%\nFigure 6.1\nNormal curve.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

This means that failure is regarded as \na random phenomenon: it is a recurring event, and we do not express \nany information on individual failures, the causes of failures, or \n \nrelationships between failures, except that the likelihood for failures \nto occur varies over time according to the given probability function. \nReliability engineering is concerned with meeting the specified \n \nprobability of success, at a specified statistical confidence level.\nSecond, reliability is predicated on \u201cintended function\u201d: generally, this \nis taken to mean operation without failure. However, even if no \n \nindividual part of the system fails, but the system as a whole does \nnot do what was intended, then the failure is still charged against \nthe \n \nsystem \n \nreliability. The system requirements specification is the \ncriterion against which reliability is measured.\nThird, reliability applies to a specified period of time.

Reliability engineering ensures \nthat components and materials will meet the requirements during the \nspecified time. Units other than time may sometimes be used: the \nautomotive industry might specify reliability in terms of miles; \nthe military might specify reliability of a gun for a certain number \nof rounds fired; or a piece of mechanical equipment may have a \nreliability rating value in terms of cycles of use.\nFourth, reliability is restricted to operation under stated conditions. \nThis constraint is necessary because it is impossible to design a \nsystem for unlimited conditions. A Mars Rover will have different \nspecified conditions than the family car. The operating environment \nmust be addressed during design and testing.\nr\neliability Program Plan\nMany tasks, methods, and tools can be used to achieve reliability. Every \n \nsystem requires a different level of reliability. A commercial airliner must \noperate under a wide range of conditions. The consequences of failure are \ngrave, but there is a correspondingly higher budget. A pencil sharpener \nmay be more reliable than an airliner, but it has a much different set of \noperational conditions, insignificant consequences of failure, and a much \nlower budget.\nA reliability program plan is used to document exactly what tasks, meth-\nods, tools, analyses, and tests are required for a particular system. For com-\nplex systems, the reliability program plan is a separate document. For simple \nsystems, it may be combined with the systems engineering management \nplan. The reliability program plan is essential for a successful reliability pro-\ngram and is developed early during system development. It specifies not \nonly what the reliability engineer does, but also the tasks performed by oth-\ners. The reliability program plan is approved by top \n \nprogram management.\nr\neliability \nr\nequirements\nFor any system, one of the first tasks of reliability engineering is to \n \nadequately specify the reliability requirements.

The most  common \nreliability parameter is mean time between failure (MTBF), which can \nalso be specified as the failure rate or the number of failures during a given \nperiod. These parameters are very useful for systems that are operated on a \nregular basis, such as most vehicles, machinery, and electronic equipment. \nReliability increases as the MTBF increases. The MTBF is usually speci -\nfied in hours, but can also be used with other units of measurement such \nas miles or cycles.\nIn other cases, reliability is specified as the probability of mission \nsuccess. For example, reliability of a scheduled aircraft flight can be \nspecified as a dimensionless probability or a percentage.\nA special case of mission success is the single-shot device or system. \nThese are devices or systems that remain relatively dormant and operate \nonly once. Examples include automobile airbags, thermal batteries, and \nmissiles. Single-shot reliability is specified as a probability of success, or is \nsubsumed into a related parameter. Single-shot missile reliability may be \nincorporated into a requirement for the probability of hit.\nFor such systems, the probability of failure on demand (PFD) is the reli-\nability measure. This PFD is derived from failure rate and mission time \nfor nonrepairable systems. For repairable systems, it is obtained from \nfailure rate and mean time to recovery (MTTR) and test \n \ninterval. This \nmeasure may not be unique for a given system, as the measure depends on \nthe kind of demand. In addition to system-level \n \nrequirements, \n \nreliability \n \nrequirements may be specified for critical subsystems. In all cases, reli -\nability parameters are specified with appropriate statistical confidence \nintervals.\nr\neliability \nm\nodeling\nReliability modeling is the process of predicting or understanding the \n \nreliability of a component or system. Two separate fields of investigation \nare common: the physics of failure approach uses an understanding of \nthe failure mechanisms involved, such as crack propagation or chemical \n \ncorrosion; and the parts stress modeling approach is an empirical method \nfor prediction based on counting the number and type of components of \nthe system, and the stress they undergo during operation.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

This is done in general \nin an accelerated experiment with increased stress. These experiments can \nbe divided into two main categories.\nEarly failure rate studies determine the distribution with a decreasing \nfailure rate over the first part of the bathtub curve. Here, in general, only \nmoderate stress is necessary. The stress is applied for a limited period \nof\n \ntime in what is called a censored test . Therefore, only the part of the \ndistribution with early failures can be determined.\nIn so-called zero-defect experiments, only limited information about the \nfailure distribution is acquired. Here the stress, stress time, or the sample \nsize is so low that not a single failure occurs. Due to the insufficient sample \nsize, only an upper limit of the early failure rate can be determined. At any \nrate, it looks good for the customer if there are no failures.\nIn a study of the intrinsic failure distribution, which is often a material \nproperty, higher stresses are necessary to achieve failure in a reasonable \nperiod of time. Several degrees of stress have to be applied to determine an \nacceleration model. The empirical failure distribution is often parameter -\nized with a Weibull or a log-normal model.\nIt is a general praxis to model the early failure rate with an exponen -\ntial distribution. This less complex model for the failure distribution has \nonly one parameter: the constant failure rate. In such cases, the chi-square \ndistribution can be used to find the goodness of fit for the estimated fail -\nure rate. Compared to a model with a decreasing failure rate, this is quite \n \npessimistic. Combined with a zero-defect experiment, this becomes even \nmore pessimistic. The effort is greatly reduced in this case: one does not \nhave to determine a second model parameter (e.g., the shape parameter \nof a Weibull distribution) or its confidence interval (e.g., by a maximum \nlikelihood approach, or MLE), and the sample size is much smaller.\nr\neliability \nt\nest \nr\nequirements\nBecause reliability is a probability, even highly reliable systems have some \nchance of failure.

Task selection depends on the \ncriticality of the system as well as cost. A critical system may require a \nformal failure-reporting and failure review process throughout develop -\nment, whereas a noncritical system may rely on final test reports. The most \ncommon reliability program tasks are documented in reliability program \nstandards, such as MIL-STD-785 (U.S. Air Force 1986) and IEEE 1332 \n(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 1998).\nd\nesign for \nr\neliability\nDesign for reliability (DFR) is an emerging discipline that refers to the \nprocess of designing reliability into products. This process encompasses \nseveral tools and practices, and describes the order of their deployment \nthat an organization needs to have in place in order to drive reliability \ninto their products. Typically, the first step in the DFR process is to set the \nsystem\u2019s reliability requirements. Reliability must be \u201cdesigned into\u201d the \nsystem. During system design, the top-level reliability requirements are \nthen allocated to subsystems by design and reliability engineers working \ntogether.\nReliability design begins with the development of a model. Reliability \nmodels use block diagrams and fault trees to provide a graphical means of \n \nevaluating the relationships between different parts of the system. These \nmodels incorporate predictions based on parts-count failure rates taken \nfrom\n \nhistorical data. While the predictions are often not accurate in an \nabsolute sense, they are valuable to assess relative differences in design \nalternatives.\nFault \nt\nree \nd\niagrams\nOne of the most important design techniques is redundancy. This means \nthat if one part of the system fails, there is an alternate success path, \nsuch as a backup system. An automobile brake light might use two light \nbulbs. If one bulb fails, the brake light still operates using the other bulb. \nRedundancy significantly increases system reliability, and is often the only \nviable means of doing so. However, redundancy is difficult and expensive, \nand is therefore limited to critical parts of the system.

Testing proceeds dur-\ning each level of integration through full-up system testing, developmen -\ntal testing, and operational testing, thereby reducing program risk. System \nreliability is calculated at each test level. Reliability growth techniques and \nfailure-reporting, analysis, and corrective action systems (FRACAS) are \noften employed to improve reliability as testing progresses. The drawbacks \nto such extensive testing are time and expense. Customers may choose to \naccept more risk by eliminating some or all lower levels of testing.\nIt is not always feasible to test all system requirements. Some systems \nare prohibitively expensive to test; some failure modes may take years to \nobserve; some complex interactions result in a huge number of possible \ntest cases; and some tests require the use of limited test ranges or other \nresources. In such cases, different approaches to testing can be used, such \nas accelerated life testing, the design of experiments, and simulations.\nThe desired level of statistical confidence also plays an important role \nin reliability testing. Statistical confidence is increased by increasing \neither the test time or the number of items tested. Reliability test plans are \ndesigned to achieve the specified reliability at the specified confidence level \nwith the minimum number of test units and test time. Different test plans \nresult in different levels of risk to the producer and consumer. The desired \nreliability, statistical confidence, and risk levels for each side influence the \nultimate test plan. Good test requirements ensure that the customer and \ndeveloper agree in advance on how reliability requirements will be tested.\nA key aspect of reliability testing is to define failure. Although this may \nseem obvious, there are many situations where it is not clear whether \na failure is really the fault of the system. Variations in test conditions, \noperator differences, weather, and unexpected situations create differ -\nences between the customer and the system developer. One strategy to \naddress this issue is to use a scoring conference process.

Software reliability engineering must take this \ninto account.\nDespite this difference in the source of failure between software and \nhardware\u2014software doesn\u2019t wear out\u2014some in the software reliability\u2013en-\ngineering community believe statistical models used in hardware reliability \nare nevertheless useful as a measure of software reliability, describing what \nwe experience with software: the longer you run software, the higher the \nprobability you\u2019ll eventually use it in an untested manner and find a latent \ndefect that results in a failure (Shooman 1987; Musa 2005; Denney 2005).\nAs with hardware, software reliability depends on good requirements, \ndesign, and implementation. Software reliability engineering relies heav -\nily on a disciplined software-engineering process to anticipate and design \nagainst unintended consequences. There is more overlap between software \nquality engineering and software reliability engineering than between \nhardware quality and reliability. A good software development plan is a \nkey aspect of the software reliability program. The software development \nplan describes the design and coding standards, peer reviews, unit tests, \nconfiguration management, software metrics, and software models to be \nused during software development.\nA common reliability metric is the number of software faults, usu -\nally expressed as faults per thousand lines of code. This metric, along \nwith software execution time, is key to most software reliability models \nand estimates. The theory is that the software reliability increases as the \nnumber of faults (or fault density) goes down. Establishing a direct con -\nnection between fault density and MTBF is difficult, however, because \nof the way software faults are distributed in the code, their severity, and \n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Nevertheless, fault density serves as a useful indicator for the reli -\nability engineer. Other software metrics, such as complexity, are also \nused.\nTesting is even more important for software than hardware. Even the \nbest software development process results in some software faults that \nare nearly undetectable until tested. As with hardware, software is tested \nat several levels, starting with individual units, through integration and \nfull-up system testing. Unlike with hardware, it is inadvisable to skip lev -\nels of software testing. During all phases of testing, software faults are dis-\ncovered, corrected, and retested. Reliability estimates are updated based \non the fault density and other metrics. At the system level, MTBF data are \ncollected and used to estimate reliability. Unlike with hardware, perform-\ning the exact same test on the exact same software configuration does not \nprovide increased statistical confidence. Instead, software reliability uses \ndifferent metrics such as test coverage.\nEventually, the software is integrated with the hardware in the top-level \nsystem, and software reliability is subsumed by system reliability. The \nSoftware Engineering Institute\u2019s capability maturity model is a common \nmeans of assessing the overall software development process for reliability \nand quality purposes.\nr\neliability Operational \na\nssessment\nAfter a system is produced, reliability engineering during the system oper-\nation phase monitors, assesses, and corrects deficiencies. Data collection \nand analysis are the primary tools used. When possible, system failures \nand corrective actions are reported to the reliability engineering organi -\nzation. The data are constantly analyzed using statistical techniques, such \nas Weibull analysis and linear regression, to ensure the system reliability \nmeets the specification. Reliability data and estimates are also key inputs \nfor system logistics. Data collection is highly dependent on the nature \nof the system. Most large organizations have quality control groups that \ncollect failure data on vehicles, equipment, and machinery. Consumer \nproduct failures are often tracked by the number of returns. For systems \nin dormant storage or on standby, it is necessary to establish a formal \nsurveillance program to inspect and test random samples.

The reli -\nability-engineering organization must be consistent with the company\u2019s \norganizational structure. For small, noncritical systems, reliability engi -\nneering may be informal. As complexity grows, the need arises for a formal \nreliability function. Because reliability is important to the customer, the \ncustomer may even specify certain aspects of the reliability organization.\nThere are several common types of reliability organizations. The project \nmanager or chief engineer may employ one or more reliability engineers \ndirectly. In larger organizations, there is usually a product assurance or \nspecialty-engineering organization, which may include reliability, main -\ntainability, quality, safety, human factors, logistics, and so on. In such \ncase, the reliability engineer reports to the product assurance manager or \nspecialty-engineering manager.\nIn some cases, a company may wish to establish an independent reli -\nability organization. This is desirable to ensure that the system reliability, \ntesting of which is often expensive and time-consuming, is not unduly \nslighted due to budget and schedule pressures. In such cases, the reliabil -\nity engineer works on the project on a day-to-day basis, but is actually \nemployed and paid by a separate organization within the company.\nBecause reliability engineering is critical to early system design, it has \nbecome common for reliability engineers; however, the organization is \nstructured to work as part of an integrated product team.\nCertification\nThe American Society for Quality (ASQ) has a program to become a \n \ncertified reliability engineer, or CRE. Certification is based on education, \nexperience, and a certification test; periodic recertification is required. The \nbody of knowledge for the test includes reliability management, design \nevaluation, product safety, statistical tools, design and development, \n \nmodeling, reliability testing, collecting and using data, and so on.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

However, it is usually easiest to break up these systems \ninto their analog and digital parts for analysis, as well as the necessary \nanalog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converter.\nAnother way to characterize systems is by whether their output at any \ngiven time depends only on the input at that time, or perhaps on the input \nat some time in the past (or in the future!).\nMemoryless systems do not depend on any past input.\nSystems with memory do depend on past input.\nCausal systems do not depend on any future input.\nNoncausal or anticipatory systems do depend on future input.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

First, the ideal system for a given application is \noften a noncausal system, which although not physically possible, can give \ninsight into the design of a derivated causal system to accomplish a similar \npurpose. Second, there are instances when a system does not operate in \n\u201creal time\u201d but rather is simulated \u201coffline\u201d by a computer.\nAnalog systems with memory may be further classified as lumped or \ndistributed.

Future output of a system with memory depends \non future input and a number of state variables, such as values of the input \nor output at various times in the past. If the number of state variables \nnecessary to describe future output is finite, the system is lumped; if it is \ninfinite, the system is distributed.\nFinally, systems may be characterized by certain properties which  \nfacilitate their analysis:\nA system is linear if it has superposition and scaling properties.\nA system that is not linear is nonlinear.\nIf the output of a system does not depend explicitly on time, the system \nis said to be time-invariant; otherwise, it is time-variant,\nA system that will always produce the same output for a given input is \nsaid to be deterministic.\nA system that will produce different outputs for a given input is said to \nbe stochastic.\nThere are many methods of analysis developed specifically for linear \ntime-invariant (LTI) deterministic systems. Unfortunately, in the case \nof analog systems, none of these properties are ever perfectly achieved. \nLinearity implies that operation of a system can be scaled to arbitrarily \nlarge magnitudes, which is not possible. Time-invariance is violated by \naging effects that can change the outputs of analog systems over time \n(usually years or even decades). Thermal noise and other random phe -\nnomena ensure that the operation of any analog system will have some \ndegree of stochastic behavior. Despite these limitations, however, it is \nusually reasonable to assume that deviations from these ideals will be \nsmall.\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

This is due to their simplicity of specification. An LTI \nsystem is completely specified by its transfer function (which is a rational \nfunction for digital and lumped analog LTI systems). Alternatively, we can \nthink of an LTI system as being completely specified by its frequency response. \nA third way to specify an LTI system is by its characteristic linear differential \nequation (for analog systems) or linear difference equation (for digital sys-\ntems). Which description is most useful depends on the application.\nThe distinction between lumped and distributed LTI systems is impor -\ntant. A lumped LTI system is specified by a finite number of parameters, \nbe it the zeros and poles of its transfer function, or the coefficients of its \ndifferential equation, whereas specification of a distributed LTI system \nrequires a complete function.\na uditing\nQuality audit is the process of systematic examination of a quality system \ncarried out by an internal or external quality auditor or an audit team. It \nis an important part of an organization\u2019s quality management system and \nis a key element in the ISO quality system standard, ISO 9001.\nQuality audits are typically performed at predefined time intervals and \nensure that the institution has clearly defined internal quality-monitoring \nprocedures linked to effective action. This can help determine if the orga -\nnization complies with the defined quality system processes and can \ninvolve procedural or results-based assessment criteria.\nWith the upgrade of the ISO 9000 series of standards from the 1994 \nto 2000 series, the focus of the audits has shifted from purely procedural \nadherence toward measurement of the actual effectiveness of the qual -\nity management system (QMS) and the results that have been achieved \nthrough the implementation of a QMS.\nQuality audits can be an integral part of compliance for regulatory \nrequirements. One example is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, \nwhich requires quality auditing to be performed as part of its Quality \nSystem Regulation (QSR) for medical devices (Title 21 of the U.S. Code of \nFederal Regulations, part 820).\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

Over time, the \nimportance of these \u201cfixed costs\u201d has become more important to managers. \nt able  6.6\nCost-of-Quality Statement\nCost Subtotal\nFailure \nc\nosts\nRaw material \nnonconformance\n$3,276\nRepairs $70,299\nScrap $2,000\nReturns $300,000\nRework $20,000\n$395,575\na\nppraisal \nc\nosts\nProduct audits $32,000\nReceiving \ninspection\n$25,000\nIn-process \ninspection\n$25,000\nFinal inspection $50,000\n$132,000\nPrevention \nc\nosts\nDesign reviews $9,000\nQuality assurance $25,000\n$34,000\nt\notal $561,575\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",

In the early twentieth century, these costs were of \nlittle importance to most businesses. However, in the twenty-first century, \nthese costs are often more important than the variable cost of a product, \nand allocating them to a broad range of products can lead to bad decision \nmaking. Managers must understand fixed costs in order to make decisions \nabout products and pricing.\nThe concept of quality costs (see Table\n \n6.6) is a means to quantify the \ntotal cost of quality-related efforts and deficiencies. It was first described \nby Armand V . Feigenbaum in a 1956 Harvard Business Review article.\nPrior to its introduction, the general perception was that higher qual -\nity requires higher costs, either by buying better materials or machines, \nor by hiring more labor. Furthermore, while cost accounting had evolved \nto categorize financial transactions into revenues, expenses, and changes \nin shareholder equity, it had not attempted to categorize costs relevant \nto quality. By classifying quality-related entries from a company\u2019s general \nledger, management and quality managers can evaluate investments in \nquality based on cost improvement and profit enhancement.\nInternal failure costs : These are costs associated with nonconformities \nthat are found during receiving, in-process inspection, and finished-\ngoods inventory prior to shipping to the customer. Examples would be the \nfollowing:\nScrap\nRework\nSupplier scrap or rework\nSorting\nRetest and reinspection\nRegrading\nExternal failure costs : These are costs associated with nonconformities \nthat are found by the customer. Examples would be the following:\nWarranty charges\nService time and material allowances\nReturned material costs\n\u00a9 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC",
